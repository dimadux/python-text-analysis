Ukraine Needs <the IMF's Tough Love K9> 
FEB 12, 2016 2:00 AM EST
The International Monetary Fund has threatened <to cut off aid E,L 5,7> to Ukraine unless the government finally cracks down on <corruption JS7/13>. It’s the right message, and the fund should be prepared <to follow through L6> <if President Petro Poroshenko fails to deliver L7>.
Make no mistake: This would be <a devastating blow B 3,12> for a country still struggling with a <Russia-inspired insurgency J 7,13> in its eastern provinces. The IMF-led $40 billion aid program <is keeping Ukraine’s economy alive C 6,10>, <if just barely L10>.
The <unfortunate truth KG 10,18> is, independent Ukraine has so far shown itself <incapable of reform E18>. It’s been almost two years since former President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted (and <Russia, in response, annexed Crimea E7>). With the conflict in the eastern Donbas region now merely simmering, <the greatest threat to Ukraine’s continued existence as an independent state is its own corruption L,E 7,16>.
The country’s persistent <vulnerability L 13> to this problem has inspired two popular <uprisings MW 7,13>, in 2004 and 2013. And <corruption E 7,16>, <especially in the energy field E 7,16>, is what has exposed the country to <manipulation J 7,13> -- and, later, <invasion LH 3,12> -- by Russia. 
So what to do? After IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde issued her <threat L 13>, Poroshenko promised to deliver a <road map to reform C 6,23>. It should include at least three proposals.
First, Ukraine needs an enforceable schedule for the <privatizing C6> most of the country’s 3,000-plus state-owned companies, whose <losses <are bleeding H 13> the budget dry E7>. Under the country’s post-Soviet system, the profits these companies earn are privatized, but assets and losses remain the responsibility of the state. So, <oligarchs E 13,21> pay <stooges E 21> in parliament and government ministries to ensure that their people are put in charge of state enterprises. These <appointees E 13,21>, in turn, can <siphon revenues to their bosses E,K 7,9> -- and <pass losses on to the state E,K 7>. 
Naturally, it will take time to sell so many companies. In the meantime, Ukraine should form an independent committee of <technocrats C6> <to cull corrupt managers C6> and <replace them with professionals C6>. 
Also, special prosecutors, who at last are being hired to work with the new <National Anti-Corruption Bureau C6>, need <to be protected from interference C6,11>, so that <corrupt officials E7/13/21> can be <brought to trial C6>. Ideally their trials will be held before special corruption courts run by judges from outside Ukraine’s compromised judiciary -- if need be, from abroad.
Poroshenko must understand that Ukraine <has reached a tipping point L,F 24,25>. Its Western donors are <running out of patience L 25>, and so are some of its own leaders. Earlier this month, Aivaras Abromavicius, the reformist economy minister, resigned, protesting that <he could no longer <act as a “smokescreen” EK 7> EK 5,24> for <malfeasance JE7/13/21>, including <meddling E7/13/21> in state enterprise appointments by a legislator who is a close business associate of Poroshenko’s. Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko and other technocrats who had hoped to produce change are also threatening to resign.  
Poroshenko’s promised road map will need to satisfy Western donors and reformist ministers alike. Indeed, the proposals it contains should be solid enough to persuade Abromavicius to return to his job. No one is in a better position to judge whether the government is getting serious about reform.

Ukraine's Politics <Descend Into Slapstick JS7/21>
DEC 15, 2015 1:23 PM EST

Less than a week after U.S. Vice President Joe Biden asked Ukraine's political leaders to play nice, the quiet <war L5> between the teams of Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and President Petro Poroshenko has <turned publicly and comically violent KL 25>.
The situation is growing increasingly reminiscent of Ukraine's previous attempt to break with Russia's dominance and embark on a European path. From 2005 to 2010, then President Viktor Yuschenko's faction clashed repeatedly with that of Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, <rampant corruption JS7,16> <undermined the economy LN 7,10,16> and <reforms proved fake MS 18>. This led to the election of President Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted last year in a <bloody uprising HG 10/16>. 
Biden's plea was timed to preempt a crucial moment: On Dec. 11, Yatsenyuk's year-long immunity from dismissal as prime minister expired, rendering him vulnerable to political attack. Biden warned Poroshenko that Ukraine's Western allies want to avoid the <political upheaval M7> that Yatsenyuk's firing would entail. Without the support of the prime minister's faction -- the second biggest in parliament -- the ruling coalition <would fall apart L7>, triggering an <early election E2>. The resulting campaigning could sideline reforms, <sorely L 16> testing the patience of <impoverished G,L 10,16> and often <armed L 13,16> voters.  
On Dec. 12, Yatsenyuk was defending his government's record in parliament when legislator Oleg Barna, a member of the presidential faction, approached him with a bunch of flowers. Nonplussed, Yatsenyuk took the bouquet. Barna then lifted him up in a body lock and attempted to drag him from the rostrum. Yatsenyuk clung to it, so Barna changed his grip, seizing the prime minister between his legs. Legislators from the Yatsenyuk party were already running to intercept Barna <like a rugby team in suits K 15>. Soon, <fists were flying all over the floor IJM7/9>. Many Ukrainian legislators <have risen through the ranks in mob-controlled coal and steel towns E18>, and their Brioni attire <is only a thin veneer K 9,18>.
"Possibly, <this wasn't a very European way to act, but I couldn't do otherwise W 17>," Barna later explained. <"If he won't leave of his own accord, people will carry him out" L,W 17>.
That's not all. On Monday, Poroshenko called together his National Reform Council. According to some reports, his aim was to follow Biden's advice, erase the <Barna incident M 7> and announce that he was going to work together with Yatsenyuk. <It didn't turn out that way S7>.
One participant was Mikheil Saakashvili, former president of Georgia and now the Poroshenko-appointed governor of the Odessa region in Ukraine, who earlier this month accused Yatsenyuk of involvement in <financial schemes E 18,19> that, he claimed, <drained J 4> $5 billion a year from Ukraine's coffers. Saakashvili's presence <angered E7> Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, a Yatsenyuk ally. According to an account he posted on Facebook, Avakov asked Saakashvili about a recently <leaked video I 18,19> purporting to show a <secret meeting U18> between the governor and a Russian businessman interested in buying an Odessa chemical factory.
"The Odessa governor <grew hysterical E,K 9,21> and started screaming at me," Avakov wrote. "I refrained from hitting him and <splashed some water in his face A 1,21>." The minister went on to call the governor "a <militant scumbag J17/19> who is looking for a pretext to <resign with a loud bang E9>, <having failed in his job E 7,18>"
Saakashvili's <version is, of course, different K9 >. He gave a press conference after the incident, claiming that Avakov <got mad E 9,18> after the governor openly called Yatsenyuk and his team <corrupt SE13/14>, that Avakov "attempted <to toss a glass at him A,L 18>" and <demanded that he leave "their country A 14>." "I am here with serious intentions and for the long haul," Saakashvili said, holding up his recently acquired Ukrainian passport. "I'm not going to leave them alone."
Both Avakov and Saakashvili demanded that Poroshenko's administration release a video of the meeting, which had been filmed. Presidential spokesman Svatoslav Tsegolko refused. "Such <street-style altercations W2> <disgrace J19/14> the country," he wrote on Facebook. He was not alone in his embarrassment. "What is going on is truly a <shame ZJ 19/14>, a <disgrace JZ 2, 14,19>, a <paucity J19/14> of both spirit and ideas," Volodymyr Omelyan, who resigned last week as deputy transport minister, wrote angrily. "I'd resign again today if I could."
<Bureaucrats E 4> drafted from the private sector after Ukraine's "<Revolution of Dignity 24 C>" are probably tempted to leave, too. Some, though, are trying to keep calm and carry on. "The government has been accused of <corruption J19/14>, and it denies the charges," said Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko, a U.S. citizen responsible for Ukraine's debt reduction deal with private creditors. "Though this is a coalition government, we work as one team. Don't try to split it."
Poroshenko can't say the same, even though he should. If he openly backs Yatsenyuk, Saakashvili may revolt and challenge him. The explosive Georgian <is popular in Ukraine C6>, and <has more political experience C6>. The president would probably prefer Saakashvili to Yatsenyuk as prime minister. Siding with the Odessa governor, though, would mean ousting Yatsenyuk , triggering an <early election E2> and <irritating M8> the U.S., where Yatsenyuk and Jaresko are popular figures.
Russian President <<Vladimir Putin's minions K9> are enjoying the showK 15>. <"The spiders are beginning to devour each other R9,15>" Alexei Pushkov, head of the Russian parliament's  foreign affairs committee, tweetedon Tuesday. A <dysfunctional SE24>, <scandal-ridden SE24> Ukrainian government <is just what Putin needs L9>. Unfortunately, the combatants appear to be past caring. Saakashvili <sees himself as a fearless anti-corruption crusader K 9>, though he <hasn't accused anyone on Porosheko's team of graft I 18,23> despite numerous opportunities. Yatsenyuk is trying to keep his job and defend his record. Poroshenko <is torn between remaining on good terms with the U.S. and consolidating power 5,10>. 
If this <circus R9> continues, <another revolt could break out L 12>. The politicians in Kiev ought to realize that the whole country is watching. Their <primitive aggression EM 7,16> and <venality E 7,18> could quickly become too much to endure.

Ukraine’s EU bid: Dutch PM says <‘ratification can’t go ahead’ NSV 10>  as Kiev says <‘nothing has changed’  I 11>
Published time: 7 Apr, 2016 09:20
Ukraine says “nothing has changed” in Kiev’s desire to <“push towards the EU BEL 5”> despite <suffering a setback Q20> after the Dutch public <overwhelmingly voted against C 6> a <treaty on closer ties between the EU and Ukraine LM 12>, while the Dutch PM says <“ratification can’t go ahead.” NSV 24>
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte had been staunchly in favor of a ‘Yes’ vote, which would have led to the Netherlands approving an association treaty – <paving the way for closer ties LM 12> between the EU and Ukraine. However, <he was forced to take into account public opinion CP 6>, with 64 percent against the deal, and the government may have to reconsider ratifying the treaty. 
"It's clear that 'No' have won by an overwhelming margin, the question is only if <turnout is sufficient IU18 ,"> Rutte stated. "If the turnout is above 30 percent with such a large margin of victory for the 'No' camp then my sense is that ratification can't simply go ahead." 
<Closer integration with Europe LU 7> and giving its citizens visa-free travel across much of the continent has been one of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko’s major goals. Despite the <resounding rejection by the Dutch public GN 7>, the Ukrainian leader seemed <to be anything but <downbeat G 10>I 23>.
“The referendum in the Netherlands <was strictly in an advisory nature Q 11>. We will continue our movement towards the European Union,” he told reporters in Tokyo. "Under any circumstances we will continue to implement the association agreement with the European Union including a <deep and comprehensive free trade agreement C 17>" Poroshenko added.

Ukraine’s Petro Poroshenko: <The biggest loser GIN 10 R9 > from the Panama Papers?
Published time: 6 Apr, 2016 16:20
<The media hype MUR 5> has focused on Vladimir Putin <(who was actually not named IU 14)> and David Cameron <(who wasn't either IU 14)>. However, <the biggest loser R9> from the Panama Paper’s fallout just might be Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko.  
By now, you’ve endured more than two years of the Western popular press <ranting and raving EMR 5,9> about “Euromaidan,” which they describe as Ukraine’s <“revolution of dignity” CP 6>. You’ve consumed endless op-eds and profiles <white-washing EIK 5> Petro Poroshenko as some kind of <noble protector of <democratic values C6> R9> in the “New Ukraine.” You’ve also been exposed to <endless propaganda AJK 5> about <Ukraine’s “European choice” CO 6> and <misled E 18,27> to believe that the country is united in its desire to <re-orientate westward CO 6>.
By contrast, Russian media has consistently labeled Maidan, a <“coup JU 19>.” Lots and lots of folk on the Western think-tank circuit and opinion pages - which are often indivisible - are angry about that. They've long accused the Russians of trying <to hoodwink people AGJ 5>. ‘Weaponizing’ nouns, if you like.   
In reality, <the Russian media is right IKL 17>. Maidan was not a revolution. The term revolution implies that there was a dramatic structural shift in Ukraine. <But there wasn’t anything of the sort AJ 5>.  In a real transformation, the entire elite are replaced. For example, a new civil service is created and probably a fresh police force.

 ‘<Won’t help E2> ordinary Ukrainians’: Dutch suspect EU/Kiev deal <more for power players than people E2>
Published time: 6 Apr, 2016 05:54
Polls have opened on Wednesday in the Netherlands to see if the public wants to back an agreement to bring Ukraine closer to the EU. While <many Dutch people support ordinary Ukrainians CP 6>, a great number believe the proposed <deal will not help them IL 10, E 2>.
At The Hague, members of the “No” camp have been out <in force trying EI 5> to convince the general public not to vote in favor of the EU’s proposed association agreement with Kiev. Despite their efforts, however, even many of those opposing the deal have expressed an <underlying desire to help Ukraine’s general population CP6>.
“This [treaty] <will not help the ordinary citizen E2> in Ukraine,” Harry van Bommel, an MP with the Socialist Party, told RT. <“It will help the oligarchs AJ 5>., it will help Poroshenko and it will help the others. I <am willing C6> and the Dutch <are willing to help Ukrainians C6>, but we can do that through neighborhood policy and all sorts of funds that are available already,” he added.  
Many Dutch people have voiced concern as to just <how ordinary Ukrainians would benefit C10> from the association agreement. Though the pact would essentially give Ukrainians visa-free travel within the vast majority of the EU, it would also <break down free trade barriers C6>, which, according to Jan Roos from the GeenStjil (No Style) magazine, would be of <little benefit NI 24> to the vast majority of those living in Ukraine.  
<“There is no trade between the Netherlands and Ukraine N 24>. The Ukrainian people are <very poor G10> so they <can’t buy our tulips or our cheese KR 9,”> Roos explained. “But <I want the best for the Ukrainian people C6> and I want them to <live in peace CQ 11>. There <is a war going on there BGL 24>, which <was caused by this association agreement IJN 22.”>

<Ukraine <conflict L7,16> affects over half a million children EGL 5, 24>, says UNICEF
At least 215,000 children have been internally displaced and many more <psychologically affected GL 10> by fighting in Ukraine. UNICEF has called for <"unhindered access"C 11> <to help those affected C6,11>.
On Friday, UNICEF reported that 580,000 <children living near the front lines ELU10, 24> of <Ukraine's civil war EJM8> or in areas not controlled by the Ukrainian government <have been affected G10> by the <fighting ELU5>.
The organization added that some 215,000 <children have been internally displaced GJN10, 24> by the <armed separatist insurgency ALU 5, 7, 13> that erupted in 2014 following the <pro-democracy protests TC1, 6> in Kyiv that led to the overthrow of Kremlin-backed President Viktor Yanukovych. 
Ukraine <remains locked in <conflict L7,16> with <separatists E7>> in the east and has seen relations with Russia <strained EL 5,24> since the <annexation of the Crimean Peninsula AEJ1, 14, 24>.
"Two years of <violence EJU 1, 5, 10>, <shelling ELU1, 5> and <fear B 10,16> have left an indelible mark on thousands of children in eastern Ukraine," said Giovanna Barberis, UNICEF's representative in the country.
"As the <conflict L7,16> continues, we need to reach these children urgently to meet their physical as well as <psychological needs GL10>," Barberis added.
According to the report, at least <20 children have been killed AHJ1, 10, 14> and <40 injured G10> in the <conflict L7,16>, including <28 casualties resulting from <mines BL13, 25> and unexploded ordnance BL13, 25> in 2015.
"UNICEF calls all parties to the <conflict in Ukraine L7,16> <to ensure safe movement C,Q 6> and <unhindered humanitarian access C,Q 6> <to help children in need G1, 6, 10>," Barberis added.
In January, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said <the civil war AL 1> was a priority for Germany's chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).
"We don't need a dialogue about dialogue, but a dialogue that doesn't cover up <violations E7> of central OSCE obligations, such as the <annexation AJ 7> of Crimea," Steinmeier said.
About 9,000 people <have died > in <Ukraine's civil war>. Russia <has been accused of <supporting the separatists ALU 1,13,14>E7,18>, though officials in Moscow deny the allegation.

<Intense fighting has erupted ELU1, 5, 16> between Kyiv troops and <pro-Russian rebels ALM1, 4, 14> in eastern Ukraine. The <violence EU5, 24>signifies the most serious escalation in the <conflict L7,16> since a <February truce deal Q11>. <Both sides are trading blame ELU1,5,13>.

<A major battle erupted AEU1, 5>Wednesday on the <outskirts of the rebel stronghold, Donetsk AM1, 13, 5>, signaling a departure from the occasional low-level flare ups that had been reported since a <ceasefire agreement C6,11> was signed four months ago.
Both sides have swapped blame for the latest<bout of violence ELU1,5>, which could <threaten to plunge the country back into <full-blown war AEU1, 5, 7>B,L 12,24>.

Netherlands <rejects ES7> EU-Ukraine <partnership deal C6>
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35976086

 Voters in the Netherlands <have rejectedES7> in a referendum an EU <partnership deal C6> to <remove trade barriers C6> with Ukraine.
Turnout was low, 32.2%, but above the 30% <threshold W25> for the vote to be valid. The deal was rejected by 61.1% of votes, compared with 38.1% in favour. Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the government might have to <reconsider the deal S24>, although the vote is not binding. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko <insisted MT6> his country would "<continue our movement T6> towards the EU". A foreign ministry official in Kiev told the BBC that the result was <disappointing ES7>, adding that Dutch Eurosceptics could not take Ukraine <hostage B13> to express <dissatisfaction ES7> with the EU. The vote was widely seen in the Netherlands as a test of public opinion towards the EU. <It was triggered U8> by an internet petition begun by Eurosceptic activists that attracted more than 400,000 signatures. The result <creates a headache F8> for the Dutch government, as the Dutch parliament <approved C6> the EU association agreement with Ukraine last year. All the other 27 EU member states have already ratified the deal. "My view is that if the turnout is more than 30%, with such a victory for the 'No' camp, ratification <cannot go ahead without discussion N5>," Mr Rutte said in a televised reaction. It is also an <embarrassment ES7> for a Dutch government that currently holds the EU presidency. Geert Wilders, who leads the anti-EU and anti-Islam Freedom Party, said the result was the "<beginning of the end BW6,24> for the EU".
Dutch <dilemma W23,24> - by Anna Holligan, BBC News, The Hague
The Dutch have delivered a <resounding no T8>, <with caveats E,J 7,25>. The referendum was ostensibly about Ukraine - but the No campaigners weren't concerned with <the intricacies W25> of the trade deal. Two-thirds of the electorate didn't cast their ballot, so some argue the result cannot be taken as a <true reflection T6> of anti-EU sentiment. Dutch PM Mark Rutte has <promised T6> to at least acknowledge the result, and politically <it will be hard to ignore T6>. Expect weeks or months of <protracted discussions ES 12,16> in The Hague, and Brussels.

<Blow E,U7> for Ukraine - by Tom Burridge, BBC News, Kiev 
The Ukrainian government is <adamant T6> that its wide-ranging deal to align itself with the EU will remain on course, despite the Dutch No vote. There is <a huge amount of political will C6>, both among top EU officials and powerful EU member states, namely Germany, for Ukraine's post-revolutionary political order to <succeed C1,6>. Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko has <insisted MT6> the referendum result will "<not be a strategic obstacle T6>  for Ukraine on the path to Europe".

Ukraine <crisis U5>: Life on street dividing Ukraine and Russia
By Svyatoslav KhomenkoBBC Ukrainian, Milove
29 August 2015
 A <dog barks U25> and crosses the street in Milove, in the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk, some distance from the conflict zone.
This could be anywhere in Ukraine. But <Friendship O11> of the Peoples Street belies its name because, on the other side of the road, lies the Russian town of Chertkovo. If the dog's owner were to go after it, in theory he could be <detained L7> for <illegally crossing E7> the state border. And there is little love lost between the two countries. <A fragile ceasefire U12> is in place, but some parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions are still witnessing <clashes L3,5,7> between Ukrainian government forces and <pro-Russia rebels A7,14>. Some food stores on the Ukrainian side take Russian roubles and attract Russian customers, who largely <ignore the legal requirement E14> to take purchased goods through an official border crossing point on the outskirts of  Milove. "Why don't they use their own shops? Because it is cheaper in Ukraine, and Ukrainian sausage and butter are tastier," <jokes CK6> one resident. Local border guards do not mind as this area is <relatively peaceful U24,25>. However, when the conflict between the Ukrainian army and <pro-Russian separatists A7,14> was at its <fiercest B3> you could <hear the guns U3,25> and some residents spent the night in <underground shelters U10,25>. A year ago a Ukrainian border guard office was shot at with a grenade launcher. <Nobody was hurt Q20>. Since then nothing much has changed other than more troops patrolling the streets. Residents still cross Friendship of the Peoples Street. Russians have installed CCTV cameras on their side of the border. The government in Kiev plans to <build a wall U7> to enforce the border with Russia and work is due to start next year. There is <little enthusiasm W5> among the inhabitants of Milove for a wall that will <separate them from their neighbours U7,16> on the other side of the street. The Ukrainians already face <stricter border controls U7,8> and the Russians are not supposed to cross with only their internal ID cards. It is <bad news U10> for Valeri Fedorovich who has for years sold local potatoes to his Russian neighbours. "I don't know what I am going to do with all those potatoes now," <he complains J6>." They are going to spend so much money on building that wall! It would be better to give it away to the people. I used to serve in Germany [in Soviet times], the Berlin Wall didn't stop anyone . The time will come and all the walls will fall." "Locals <don't feel threatened Q11> by Russia," says the head of Milove's administration, Vladimir Mirny.

Ukraine bans Soviet symbols and criminalises sympathy for communism
New laws <also honour U23> <controversialistU18> nationalist groups that committed <ethnic cleansing E7> or <allied with the NazisE7> for part of second world war
Two new laws that <banC6> communist symbols while <honouring C6> nationalist groups that <collaborated with the NazisA21> have come into effect in Ukraine, <raising concernsL24> that Kiev could <be stifling free speech E24L7> and further <fragmenting the war-torn country L24> in the< rushU25> <to break ties with its Soviet past C6>.
The first law “on the<condemnation C6> of the <communist and Nazi totalitarian regimes BE16>” <forbidsC6> both <Soviet and Nazi symbols E16>, making something as<trivial K9> as <selling a USSR souvenir J9>, or <singing the Soviet national hymn J9> or the Internationale, punishable by up to five years in prison for an individual and up to 10 years in prison for members of an organisation.
It also <makes it a <criminal offence E 7,16> to deny the “criminal character of  <the communist totalitarian regime BE 16> C6> of 1917-1991 in Ukraine ” in the media or elsewhere.  
The second law <recognises controversial nationalist groups L16> – including the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) – as <“independence fighters”R21> and makes it a criminal offence <to question the legitimacyU7> of their actions. While these two groups at different times <fought both Soviet and German forces C6>, they also <collaborated with the Nazis EU 7> and <took part in <ethnic cleansing BH 3,5,16> BE 4,7>. One of the authors of the law is the son of UPA leader Roman Shukhevych.
Supporters of the laws say they are a way <to build <a national identityC`6>C6> and <condemn <totalitarianismE7>C6>, but the <legislation has  been roundly condemned E7> by academics and human rights organisations, as well as Ukrainian activists. While other eastern European countries have also <banned communist symbolsW23>, Ukraine’s law is more <wide-reaching L1> than previous measures.  
The laws could also have a <divisive impact L7> on a fragmented country in which many citizens, especially in the southern and eastern regions, are <in favour of close ties with RussiaE7> rather than Kiev’s <pro-western policiesC6> and <sympathise with the Russia-backed separatistsE7> in eastern Ukraine.
Long <a hot-button issue L23>, Ukraine’s Soviet past has become especially contentious after the <ousting of president Viktor Yanukovych C6> last year and the <conflict against <Russia-backed separatists E7,14>L5> in two eastern regions, which has claimed at least 6,100 lives since April 2014. In what has become known as <“Leninfall” K 9>, activists <have torn downU25> more than 100 monuments to Vladimir Lenin around the country, sometimes <clashingL5> with <pro-Russian protestersE7>.
Two other laws taking effect on Thursday open up Soviet archives and officially <replace the Soviet term “Great Patriotic War” with “<second world warC6> C6>”, <in common with western countriesC6>.
In an open letter after the laws on <independence fighters C6> and <communist symbolsE7> were passed by parliament, 70 scholars and experts on Ukraine from around the world called on president Petro Poroshenko not to sign them, arguing that their content <contradicts the right to freedom of speech L5>. 
The letter read: “Not only would it be a <crimeE7> to question the legitimacy of an organisation [the UPA] that <slaughtered tens of thousands of Poles E14> in one of the <most heinous acts E`H 7> of <ethnic cleansingH7> in the history of Ukraine, but also it would exempt from criticis the OUN, one of the most <extreme political groups U25> in western Ukraine between the wars, and one which <collaborated with Nazi E7> Germany at the <outset of the Soviet invasion in 1941 W23>. It also took part in <anti-Jewish pogromsE7> in Ukraine.”
It warned that the “<wholesale condemnation U25> of the entire Soviet period as one of <occupation of Ukraine E7> will have <unjustL7> and <incongruousL25> consequences,” noting that even <someone who <speaks positively C6> of the perestroika market reforms under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, for instance, could be <condemned E7> E5>. 
Dunja Mijatović, the representative for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe on freedom of the media, said the “<broadly and vaguely defined language U19>” in the anti-communist law “could easily lead to <suppression of political, provocative and critical speech E7>, especially in the media”. The US <Holocaust Memorial Museum also <condemned E7> the independence-fighter legislation C6>.  
Even if the laws are not invoked <to send souvenir sellers and historians to prison K9>, they will promote <ultranationalism U7> and “<anti-communist hysteria K25>”, said Denis Pilaš, an activist with the Ukrainian group Left Opposition, who co-wrote a <scathing analysis E15> of the law in the journal Commons.
“The main <danger BL 25> of these laws is the <movement of the political discourse to the rightE7> and the <violence of the far right E5> against leftwing activists,” he told the Guardian. “It’s a further step toward the legitimisation of these things – <conservatism W25> and <violence against leftists L7> – which have been growing for the past three to four years.”
In addition, the anti-communist legislation could <entail millions of dollars U18> in expenses for renaming the huge number of cities, streets and other places connected with communist figures or the Soviet Union <at a time when Ukraine is in <economic crisis E5> M 3,19>. Already local politicians have discussed a new names for the cities of Dnipropetrovsk and Kirovohrad, which were renamed in honour of communist revolutionaries Grigory Petrovsky and Sergey Kirov during Soviet times.
Also on Thursday, Ukraine’s parliament passed a <resolution abstaining from certain international human rights obligations U 7>, specifically to allow those <detained on suspicion of terrorism U 16,25> in the <“anti-terrorist operation” K 21> <against separatists C6> in eastern Ukraine <to be held for more than 72 hours E7>, as well as for the creation of <military administrations UW 25> in some cities.
According to Yulia Gorbunova of Human Rights Watch, the move is a <legal step C6> to allow Ukrainian authorities <to deviate from certain norms E7> in these treaties as they <take measures against the separatist uprising U 25>, as long as these <deviations E7> are <proportionate U25>. 
“They can <deviate from certain human rights obligations E7> because of the situation of <emergency Q17>, but it is by no means <carte blanche for human rights violations L 7,25>,” Gorbunova said. “Where the state <<abused EJ 7> its right <to deviate from human rights treaties EM 7> EJ 7,19 >, that will be decided by the United Nations Human Rights commitee or by the European Court of Human Rights.”

Ukraine's desperate attempt to defuse<landmines BH 3> – as more are planted
 http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/04/ukraine-attempt-defuse-landmines-as-more-are-planted
Ukraine has launched an< unprecedented operationC6> in its <war-torn eastE5>< to defuse a landmine crisisC6>, the scale of which is only now becoming apparent as former <refugees try to reclaim their homesC6> and <return to workC6>.
Although the country <ratified the 1997 mine ban treatyC20>, its armed forces and Russian-backed rebels have both <made widespread use of their stockpiled, Soviet-made devicesE24>. The <UN C6> estimates that< mines are strewn acrossL24> at least 30,000 (74,000 acres) hectares of land, far <beyond the reach G24> of current clearance efforts.
<Landmines and unexploded ordnanceH3> (UXO) <have killedE24> more than 600 soldiers and civilians, <including dozens of childrenH24>, and <woundedE7> more than 2,000 during almost two years of war. As the <deadlock persistsE7>, these indiscriminate weapons now <pose a greater riskL24> to non-combatants than open warfare, causing about 80% of all Ukraine’s <civilian casualtiesH10>.
<A truce helped Q7> diminish the new wave of <artillery attacks that had eruptedE7> at the start of November, though< fighting has again escalated A1, L16,24> in certain pockets of the front. Military commanders are <exploiting periodic lullsC6> to deploy taskforces of< sappers to remove minesC11, UXO and booby trapsC11> throughout the “<grey zoneU24>” – <the battle-scarred land in limboH24>that <straddlesL7> sovereign Ukraine and rebel-held territory. 
<Squads of deminersC20> now face years of< dangerous work L6>as they <spearheadC6> Ukraine’s intensified <mine-clearance programmeC6>, even while their fellow< soldiers continue to plant the deadly devicesT6> elsewhere <to defend their positionsC6> along the volatile contact line.
“Sappers make two mistakes in life,” <joked G10> Igor Byrukov, an officer supervising an early morning operation outside the strategic port city of Mariupol. “<First, marriage; second, stepping on a mine.GH 24>”
In the expanse of field beyond, a trio of mine-clearers< prodded the earth with polesH1>; power lines above <had rendered their antiquated sensors useless G14>– a predictable <headache for the menG5> of Ukraine’s <ramshackle armyL24>. Of particular <concernL24> were anti-personnel OZM-72s, which <spring into the airH7> and <explodeH7> when a wire is tripped. Another device is dubbed the “<black widowH1>” – “very effective at< tearing apart bone and fleshH5>”, Byrukov explained.
Among the men was a young sapper called Alexey. Before the <treacherous missionG8>, the 22-year-old had tucked a photo of his family inside his flak jacket and positioned it over his heart. “I used <to be scaredH1> every time,” said the father-of-one. “Now I feel no fear – it’s just a regular job.”
Another, Yuriy, 43, had lost count of the dozens of <dangerous mine-clearance operationsG6> he <had undertakenC6>, and attributed his survival to the crucifix around his neck. He insisted that <mines should now be bannedC6>. “At the very least, they <must be a last resortC13>,” Yuriy sighed.
The sappers’ superior, Oleksandr, 45, looked on from the field’s edge as his men delicately rooted around the fertile, black soil for  explosive remnants. “We’re <ramping upC6> our operations while the <ceasefire lastsC11>,” he said. “But the job will last for years. There’s a <big mess to clean upC10>.”

Soldiers are not the only ones subjected to< the horrifying impactH7> of landmines – <civilian casualtiesH7> are common too. Gregory Voyevoda, 65, a veteran neurosurgeon, had resorted to farming wheat to supplement his <meagre salaryG24> despite his high level of education. During a <pause in hostilitiesC11> last September, the grandfather returned to harvest his small patch of land near the front and was <critically injuredG13> when his tractor <triggered an anti-tank mineH24>.
“I heard a click and instantly knew something was wrong,” Voyevoda said. “I opened the door to jump out but it was too late.”
<The powerful explosionH1> inflicted second- and third-degree burns down his lower body,  shredded the muscles in his right forearm, shattered the bones in his feet and pumped his legs full of shrapnel. He spent 10 weeks in hospital before returning to his cramped, Soviet-era flat in Mariupol, where his daughter dresses his agonising wounds daily.
Despite <the horrorH3>, he< holds no grudge I23>against the soldier who laid the landmine, <nor does he agreeI23> with those who say the weapons should be banned. “War is war,” he said. “All our factories can be destroyed and rebuilt. All our men can be killed and women will give birth again. Our land, though, can <never be replacedC6>. You must use anything to protect it.”
Children are <at particular riskL24> from the devices, which may be brightly coloured, mistaken for toys and small enough to pick up or kick around. However, Unicef says there <is no proper systemE7> for tracking <the number of children killedE24> and <maimedE24> in eastern Ukraine’s minefields, and has criticised the country’s health ministry for providing <“unrealistic figures”E7> on child casualties.
A recent <report by Human Rights WatchC6> <revealedU18> that hundreds of schools in eastern Ukraine had been <attacked E7> or <occupiedE7> by one of the warring parties. It described how HRW researchers had discovered <undetonated landminesL24> in the grounds of one school, apparently thrown off a supply truck while it was parked in the schoolyard.
In an interview with the Kiev Post, Zeljko Lezaja, a landmine expert with the International Committee of the Red Cross, said: “<Mines don’t recognise ceasefiresL24>, they <don’t recognise friends or enemies L24>. It costs some $3 to produce a mine, but about $1,000 to clear one.”
In February, four <civilians were killedE24> near Donetsk when a minivan transporting them from <separatist-held territoryL7> tried to jump a checkpoint queue by pulling on to the verge and drove over a landmine.
Sappers in Ukraine have so far <destroyed around 49,000 explosives C6>, according to official figures, although both foreign monitors and the warring sides <struggle to estimateC6> how many remain. <Victim-activated booby-trapsE4> have been used throughout the conflict zone <despite being outlawed by the 1997 treatyE7>, which came into effect in 1999.
Edward Crowther, of the <Danish Demining GroupC6>, which <is urgingC6> a coordinated, international response to <Ukraine’s landmine crisis L10,24>, said one <problem EL 13,16> was a <lack of hard data E7> about the scale of <the problem EL 13,16>. “<It’s clearC23> that these devices have been heavily used up and down the contact line,” he said. “As the <conflict slips into a frozen phaseW16> and people attempt to <return home to assess the damageC6> and <resume their livesC11>, it’s likely that there will be <a spike in casualtiesL24>.”

Britain signs new defence pact to help Ukraine 
in Russia <confrontation ALU 7,13>
Britain is to sign a new defence pact with Ukraine pledging <to help С6> the country with more military training and intelligence amid its <confrontation ALU 7,13> with Russia. 
Michael Fallon, <the Defence Secretary C6>, said the new agreement was a signal Britain would <“stand firm” Q6> with the beleaguered eastern European nation. 
The 15-year-long agreement will see British troops take part in more joint exercises and carry out more training with Ukrainian forces who have been <battling <Russian-backed separatists A7>C6> for two years. 
The countries will also <cooperate on sharing C6 military intelligence> and expertise. 
Mr Fallon said: “The UK will stand firm with Ukraine as they <defend their <territorial integrity T6>C6>. This new defence agreement sets out that commitment as we enhance our training of Ukrainian armed forces.” 
The new agreement <revives an earlier pact P6> that <lapsed in 2006 S24> because of the <anti-EU stance E,M 13,22>of the then <pro-Russian Ukrainian president A7>, Viktor Yanukovych, officials said. 
<The overthrow A7> of Mr Yanukovych in 2014 was the trigger for Russia <to annex Crimea J7> and for <pro-Russian separatists A7> to rise up and <seize large swathes E7 L13 > of the Donbass region including Donetsk and Lugansk.  
Moscow has denied Nato accusations that it has sent <large numbers of undercover troops S5> and sophisticated equipment to support <the separatists A7>. 
A year-old <ceasefireCQ6> <has failedS7> <to stop fighting C5> in the region and over 9,000 soldiers and civilians <have been killed G10,EL7> since the <conflict A1,E7> began in April 2014. 
<Small teams of British troops C6> have already carried out training missions in the country, trying to teach <life-saving battlefield C6> medicine and basic infantry tactics. 
However <the Kiev government K9 ?> has repeatedly called for more help.

Poland to establish 46,000-strong national guard <in the face of war L 1,13> in eastern Ukraine
6:57PM GMT 25 Jan 2016
Poland plans to establish a 46,000-strong national guard to bolster the country’s defences <in the face of  AL 1,13> in eastern Ukraine and <fears of Russian expansionism L7>. 
Although still under planning, it is expected the force will be based on the <US National Guard C6> with regions forming their own divisions. The Polish defence ministry said that it hopes the first units will be established this year near <the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad A7>. 
<The guard P11> looks set to become a new branch of the Polish army and separate from Poland’s established national reserve force, which compliments regular army units. 
“We already have the <‘green light’ С6> and have started on the preliminary measures for <forming a territorial defence force Q6> that will be an integral part of the army,” said Antoni Macierewicz, the Polish defence minister, adding that creating the guard was one of the ministry’s <“most important” goals T11>.
<Alarmed L 1> by the <Ukrainian conflict EL 7,16>and Russia’s apparent <willingness to use force LU 7,8,13> in neighbouring countries, Poland has embarked on a <massive spending spree LU 1,7> on <weapons L 1> and its armed forces.  
Last year its <defence budget increased C6 > by 18 per cent on 2014 to £6.6 billion, with the initial budget for the <national guard C6> put at £51-60 million. 
"We'll start with three <brigades C6> in 2016," Bartlomiej Misiewicz, a defence ministry spokesman, told the TVN24 news network. "We are committed to placing them in the north-east of the country.” 
Although the first guards will stand just a few miles from the Russian border the plan foresees <divisions spread across the entire country CQ 6>, with units <recruiting from the local population С6>. 
The idea of using locals could also help a national guard <protect Poland from the unusual military operations C,T 1,6> and the <“little green men” A 7, K 9,16> — <regular Russian troops A7, L1> in unmarked green uniforms used in Crimea and eastern Ukraine — that have become a hallmark of Russia’s use of <hybrid warfare L25>. 
Mixing <conventional and irregular warfare L25>, <hybrid L25> aims to <destabilise and undermine an opponent B1>, so Poland hopes national guard units with local knowledge will be able to <distinguish between any <friend CQ 6> and <foe ALE 1,13>CP 6,11> they might encounter in time of <crisis E7,16>.  
According to initial plans, other <national guard units С7> could <receive more training and better weapons C6> and so <<be capable of fighting T 1,6> on the <front line L1>T11> with regular troops.

14. Ukraine conflict: Separatists 'ready to stay in Ukraine' as violence continues
6:53PM BST 09 Jun 2015
Eight <Ukrainian servicemen H10> <were killed G10> <fighting with <Russian-backed separatists A7>A1,C6> in 24 hours on Tuesday, a military spokesman said. 
Seven of the soldiers <were killed GN 10> when their <vehicle was blown up BHN18> by a <landmine B 3,16> near <the separatist EL 7,13 stronghold A7> of Donetsk, Andriy Lisenko said at a briefing in Kiev.  
<The continued violence B7> comes after <separatists EL 7,13> unveiled detailed proposals for reform of the Ukrainian constitution, in an apparent abandonment of their <insistence on full independence J12> from Kiev.
The proposals, drawn up by negotiators for <the self-proclaimed A7> Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, outline a <“special status” E7> for parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk Regions as “an integral part of Ukraine”.
<Separatist officials A7> nominally agreed to remain within Ukraine under <the Minsk peace plan C11> negotiated in February. Leaders have previously said <<reintegration with Ukraine C6> <is impossible E7>S7>. 
Last month <separatists A7> said they were shelving the project <to recreate “Novorossia” A7>, a Tsarist-era term for a <swathe L 7,13> of southern Ukraine that they previously said they wanted <to “liberate” K21> from Kiev.

Netherlands rejects EU-Ukraine partnership deal
Voters in the Netherlands have rejected in a referendum an EU partnership deal to remove trade barriers with Ukraine.
Turnout was low, 32.2%, but above the 30% threshold for the vote to be valid. The deal was rejected by 61.1% of votes, compared with 38.1% in favour.
Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the government might <have to reconsider the deal, although the vote is not binding P 11>.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko insisted his country would <"continue our movement towards the EU O P 6 11">.
A foreign ministry official in Kiev told the BBC that <the result was disappointing S7>, adding that Dutch Eurosceptics could not take Ukraine hostage <to express dissatisfaction with the EU K 23>. 
The vote was widely seen in the Netherlands as a <test of public opinion C 11> towards the EU.
It was triggered by an internet petition begun by <Eurosceptic activists L 7> that attracted more than 400,000 signatures.
<The result creates a headache for the Dutch government R 25>, as the Dutch parliament approved the EU association agreement with Ukraine last year. All the <other 27 EU member states have already ratified the deal K 6>.
"My view is that if the turnout is more than 30%, with such a victory for the 'No' camp, <ratification cannot go ahead without discussion K 11>," Mr Rutte said in a televised reaction. It is also <an embarrassment N25> for a Dutch government that currently holds the EU presidency.
Geert Wilders, who leads the <anti-EU and anti-Islam Freedom Party E 78>, said the result was the "<beginning of the end for the EU" E 7, 8>.
The Dutch have delivered a resounding no, with caveats.
<The referendum was ostensibly about Ukraine E 3> - but the No campaigners weren't concerned with the intricacies of the trade deal. <Two-thirds of the electorate didn't cast their ballot G F 7>, so some argue the result cannot be taken as a true reflection of anti-EU sentiment.
Dutch PM <Mark Rutte has promised to at least acknowledge the result C 11>, and politically <it will be hard to ignore С 10>. Expect weeks or months of protracted discussions in The Hague, and Brussels.
<The Ukrainian government is adamant that its wide-ranging deal to align itself with the EU will remain on course O 11>, despite the <Dutch No vote E7>.
There is a <huge amount of political will С 1>, both among top EU officials and powerful EU member states, namely Germany, for Ukraine's post-revolutionary political order to succeed.
Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko has insisted the referendum result will <"not be a strategic obstacle for Ukraine on the path to Europe T 1>". And Dmytro Kuleba, a senior foreign ministry official, told me that "Dutch Eurosceptics cannot take Ukraine hostage to express dissatisfaction about the EU".
The vote comes less than three months before British citizens decide in their own referendum whether to leave the EU altogether.
A spokesman for campaign group Leave.EU, Brian Monteith, said: "This <humiliating rejection E21> of the Ukraine agreement demonstrates that people don't have to support the EU and its <expansionist E7> agenda to feel European."
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev also appeared to welcome the result, tweeting that it was an indication of the European attitude to Ukraine's political system.
<The Russian government was vehemently opposed to the EU deal with Ukraine  E 19 22> and was widely thought to have pressed then-President Viktor Yanukovych <to reject E7,8> it in November 2013. Mr Yanukovych's decision prompted <protests L5,7> in Kiev that ultimately led to his downfall. 
<Yes campaigners C6> have accused <anti-EU politician E7> Geert Wilders of <cosying up E22> to Russia's president
<<Pro-Russian separatists E,L7,13> in eastern Ukraine <have widely been blamed for the <killing of 298 people JN 10,22>E7> when a Malaysia Airlines <flight from Amsterdam was shot down JH 14> in July 2014 GH 10 24>. The Netherlands <lost 193 of its citizens G10>.

Ukraine crisis L13,16: 'Russian soldier's' lawyer <found dead B 10,16>
No motive for the apparent <killing BG 3,10 > of Yuriy Hrabovsky has been given
The Ukrainian lawyer of an alleged Russian special forces soldier <has been found dead G H 3 7>, days after disappearing in the middle of his trial in Kiev, Ukrainian officials say.
Yuriy Hrabovsky's body was found in a forest 125km (78 miles) south of Kiev.
He represented Alexander Alexandrov, who was <captured in eastern Ukraine with Yevgeny Yerofeyev last May L18>.
They are accused of <waging war against Ukrainian troops E 7,18>. Russia says they were <volunteers who had left active service M17>.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said early this week (in Ukrainian) <he was ready to exchange the two Russians for Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko C 6>. 
<She was sentenced to 22 years in jail G10> after being <convicted of directing artillery fire E 7,19> which <killed two Russian journalists B 7,19> in eastern Ukraine in June 2014. 
She denied all the charges.
The trial of the two Russians in Kiev was stopped at the beginning of the month, after <Yuriy Hrabovsky went missing L25>.
Anatoliy Matios says <Hrabovsky's body was found during a police excavation of land G 6?> on a former farming collective.
"Provisionally, I can say that... (he) <was killed in a violent way and finished off with a firearm G 10 13 14>," Mr Matios said.
He added that the lawyer <had been robbed B 5,14> and also <had an explosive device attached to his leg BGH 3,13,14>.
Two men have been detained on suspicion of involvement, but no motive has been mentioned.
<Russia's foreign ministry blamed Ukrainian authorities C6 /EJ19,22> for <failing to protect E7> Hrabovsky.
In a statement, it said the lawyer <had become a victim of anti-Russian sentiment in Ukraine E 7,19,22>. 
The Russian pair are alleged to be officers in Russia's GRU foreign military intelligence when they were captured during fighting in east Ukraine.
Ukrainian officials say Mr Alexandrov and Mr Yerofeyev <confessed to serving in the Russian special services C 11>, but later retracted their confessions.
The two men deny charges of <terrorism EL 5,13>. <Prosecutors have called for life sentences G 10>.
Their detention <was a major success for Ukrainian forces C6>, which had long maintained that <Russian special forces were playing a key role in the military campaign by pro-Russian rebels G 7 12>.
Ukraine's security chief told the BBC at the time that they had been part of a 220-strong GRU team deployed in Luhansk.
While Ukraine and the West have said <there is clear evidence P 18> of <Russian military help L 5,13>, the government in Moscow has argued that <only volunteers have joined the separatists in the east C17>.

<Pro-Russia rebels BLU 7 13>  order UN to leave east Ukraine <stronghold BL 7>
Pro-Russian rebels have ordered <UN agencies C6> working in the <separatist stronghold BL 7 8 14  > of Lugansk in east Ukraine to leave the area by Friday, the UN aid chief said.
Several international non-governmental organizations have separately been told to leave Lugansk by Saturday, Stephen O'Brien said in a statement Thursday.
O'Brien said he was <"alarmed" L24> by the decision and called on the <separatists E 7,8> "in both Lugansk and Donetsk <to ensure the immediate resumption  T6> of UN and international NGO activities."
<Pro-Russian leaders U 16 7> said earlier <they had banned 10 Western relief groups ELM 7 8 > including Doctors Without Borders (MSF) for <"grave violations" of laws E 14,21>.
The Lugansk <guerrillas LU 16 14 7> have accused MSF of <"illegally storing psychotropic medication" L 7 14 > that lacked proper registration in either Russia or Ukraine. MSF strongly denies the allegations.
O'Brien, the UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said some 16,000 tons of <humanitarian aid had not been delivered EGJ 7 14> and that local hospitals <could not perform surgery SLI 7 8> because <they lack anesthesia JSV 7>
In an indirect appeal to Russia, O'Brien urged "everyone with influence over the de facto authorities to use that influence to ensure the immediate resumption of <humanitarian aid Q 6 11 20> by UN agencies and international NGOs."
The move came ahead of an October 2 meeting in Paris of Russian President Vladimir Putin with his Ukrainian counterpart Petro Poroshenko to try <to advance peace prospects QC 11 6>.
The United Nations estimates that the <17-month conflict GJ 10 24> in east Ukraine has <claimed the lives of nearly 8,000 people HLU 10,5> and <injured almost 18,000 HLU 10,5> -- most of them civilians.

Ukraine’s parliamentary speaker set to become new PM
Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk has <signalled his support W 23>for parliamentary speaker Volodymyr Groysman to replace him after tendering his resignation on Sunday.
Groysman is an ally of President Petro Poroshenko and if parliament approves his appointment on Tuesday, Poroshenko will have consolidated his power by installing a member of his own party as premier. 
The BPP has nominated V.Groysman to the post of PM. Having done all <to ensure stability C 2>, I declare my decision <to transfer the responsibil-s WU 6>
Yatsenyuk’s going has come as no surprise. His government has been accused of <inaction JE 7 4 5> and< corruption EJU 5 7 24> and in February he only <narrowly survived a vote of no confidence U 7,16> in parliament. 
He <announced his resignation CW 11> in a TV broadcast and on social media.
I have taken the decision to resign as Prime Minister of Ukraine. On Tuesday, April 12 my request will be submitted to the Parliament
But Kyiv residents said the resignation of Yatseniuk was <unlikely to improve the situation in the country>, with some  earing it <could become worse LV 7,16>.
“Yatsenyuk <was a populist E 7,18>. Actually all measures he initiated, all the work he did was <for the sake of his image IMS 24 7,18>.
In reality the laws they passed were aimed at <lobbying particular groups and certain interests EI 7,18>. They were just <splitting the funds and channeling away the money ES 24,18>.”
“I think it (situation) will become even worse. Perhaps it looks like it can’t get any worse than it is now already but judging by the fact that (parliamentary speaker Volodymyr) Groysman will be appointed a new prime minister, as experts say, it <will be even worse for us LU 7,16>,”
Any new government will now <be under intense pressure LV 25>, both from Ukraine’s European and American partners, and the Ukrainian people, to implement real reform.

3)<Dutch reject closer EU-Ukraine ties QC 9 10> in referendum
http://www.france24.com/en/20160407-netherlands-voters-reject-closer-eu-ukraine-ties-referendum
Dutch voters have overwhelmingly <rejected a Ukraine-European Union treaty on closer political and economic ties QC 9 10>, in a rebuke to their government and to the European Union establishment.  
The treaty, which had already been signed by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s government and <approved by all other European Union nations C6> as well as Ukraine, took effect provisionally in January.
But that didn’t stop Dutch voters on Wednesday <rejecting the deal by a 64-36 margin in a national referendum CQU 21 22>. In another <sign of antipathy Q 10>, <only 32 percent of voters went to the polls Q11>, fewer than in other recent elections and <barely enough for the result to be considered valid Q11>.
Voters said they were <voicing their opposition C 22> not only to the treaty itself but also to European policymakers on matters ranging from the <migrant crisis BEJ 24> to economic policy, not long before <Britain’s June vote on whether to stay in the EU L7/C 6,23>.
Although the Dutch referendum was non-binding, Rutte acknowledged late on Wednesday it was politically impossible for his <unpopular government SE 23 >to continue ratifying the treaty in its current form.
However, as the Dutch currently hold the EU’s rotating presidency, he will need time to figure out whether and how he can <alter the treaty in a way that could satisfy all parties CQ 11>.
Rutte said the government would consult with parliament and European partners “step by step. <That could take days or weeks W 24>”
Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko said on Thursday <his country will continue moving towards the European Union UI 11/5> <despite the Dutch vote F 21>.
“Under any circumstances we <will continue to implement the association agreement with the European Union CT 11> including a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement CQ 11,” he told reporters in Tokyo. 
Moscow has said <it regards the Dutch vote as an internal affair Q 22,25>.
Any proposed changes to the EU-Ukraine treaty will have to pass both houses of Dutch parliament, including the Senate, where Rutte’s <shaky coalition UX 25> <lacks a majority UX 25>. Some political commentators have predicted <a coalition collapse L 8> over the issue, though <new elections must be called UW 11,25> no later than March 2017 anyway.

Panama to form financial review commission amid <scandal LU 1 3>
http://www.france24.com/en/20160407-panama-form-financial-review-commission-amid-scandal
Panama said on Wednesday it would form <an independent commission CQT 11> to review the country’s financial practices following <the leak of information LIU 18,23> from a local law firm that has <embarrassed a clutch of world leaders KI 9,23>.
“The Panamanian government, via our foreign ministry, will create an independent commission of domestic and international experts ... to evaluate our current practices and propose the adoption of measures that we will share with other countries of the world <to strengthen the transparency of the financial and legal systems OPC 20>,” President Juan Carlos Varela said in a televised address.
Governments across the world <have begun investigating L 14,18> possible <financial wrongdoing E 9> by the rich and powerful after the <leak of more than 11.5 million documents IJS 9,23>, dubbed the “Panama Papers,” from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.
In his brief statement, Varela reiterated Panama would work with other countries over the <leak L 23>, which was published in <an investigation LU 18,23> by the U.S.-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and various news organizations.
The papers <have revealed financial arrangements of prominent figures UI 18>, including <friends of Russian President Vladimir Putin EIL 15,9>, relatives of the prime ministers of Britain and Pakistan and Chinese President Xi Jinping, as well as Ukraine’s president.  
Panama is still considering who will be in the commission, and Gian Castillero, a senior government adviser, said in an interview he expected it to report within six months.
Castillero conceded that <the leak L 23> had <hurt the reputation of Panama EU 7,10>, which has an economy that was <83 percent services-based L 10>, he said.
France’s government responded to the revelations on Tuesday by saying <it would put Panama back on its list of “uncooperative countries” BLN 12>, though Castillero was <dismissive Q 11> of the move. 
“The declarations from France are emotional and political declarations which shouldn’t be repeated,” he said in response to a question about whether other countries could follow France’s lead. 
Castillero stressed that no proof had been found to show Mossack Fonseca had acted improperly. And he was adamant that <the fact that founding partner Ramon Fonseca was a friend of Varela’s EU 18> <would not affect the government’s judgment Q 6,11> of the firm.
“I <don’t think it’s really that difficult Q 6,11,17>,” he said.

Panama Papers: Ukraine President Poroshenko denies tax claims
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko says he did nothing wrong, after leaked documents suggested he had set up an <offshore company EJ 7,18> as <a tax haven K 6,11,23> using Panamanian legal firm Mossack Fonseca.  
Ukraine prosecution officials said <there was no evidence of a crime Q17> but one politician called for the president <to face impeachment proceedings EGS 5,14>.
Eleven million documents from Mossack Fonseca show how some of its clients use it< to avoid tax EJMS 7,8> and< launder money EJMS 7,8>.
The firm says it did nothing illegal.

The Panamanian firm is alleged to have set up a company in the British Virgin Islands for Mr Poroshenko called Prime Assets Partners, which describes itself as a holding company of the Roshen confectionery group. Before becoming president, Mr Poroshenko had been known as <the "chocolate king" K 9,23>.
During his presidential campaign in 2014, Mr Poroshenko vowed to sell most of his business assets. He won the election and was sworn in in June 2014. The assets were transferred to the newly created holding company.

In October 2014 a Ukrainian bank, of which Mr Poroshenko owns a controlling stake, sent a letter of recommendation to Mossack Fonseca saying that his accounts had been <"conducted properly QT 6> <up to our satisfaction Q6>", according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
Journalists from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) argued that President Poroshenko's action might <be illegal UV 7,25>on two counts: <starting a new company while president EU 7,25> and <not reporting the company EU 7,25> on his disclosure statements. The BBC cannot independently confirm this.
<Anti-corruption CT1> group Transparency International also believed that the "<creation of businesses while serving as president E 7,28> is a direct <violation of the constitution UV 24>".
But a spokesman for Mr Poroshenko said the company it set up for the president had no active assets and was part of a <legitimate corporate restructure CQT 6> aimed at helping to sell the Roshen group. <None of the three associated accounts held more than €2,000 Q17> (£1,600; $2,270), he said.
The Ukrainian leader went on Facebook to insist that, on becoming president, he <had delegated management of his assets Q 17> to consulting and law firms.
"I believe I might be <the first top office official C6> in Ukraine who treats <declaring of assets C6>, <paying taxes C6> and <conflict of interest LU 25> issues profoundly and seriously, <in full compliance with the Ukrainian and international private law C6>," he wrote.
Legal firm Avellum, which was given the task of selling Roshen, said that using a company with foreign jurisdiction was the only way to move the company into a blind trust. "Any allegations of <tax evasion EJMS 7,8> <are groundless Q17>," it told Reuters news agency.

Ukraine <crisis L 5,13>: Russia conditions <unacceptable E7> - Poroshenko
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has said Russian conditions in ongoing <negotiations C6>in Belarus over the <conflict A1, BEF 5,24> in Ukraine are "<unacceptable E7>".
He was speaking to reporters during a break in marathon talks involving Russian President <Vladimir Putin AE 4,13>.
The four-way meeting, also being attended by the leaders of France and Germany, began late on Wednesday and continued into Thursday morning.
Thousands of people have been <killed B3>in the fighting in the east of Ukraine.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande are leading the <peace initiative C6> in Minsk.
After about 14 hours of overnight talks, Mr Poroshenko said there was "no good news yet".
He told reporters that Russia had set "conditions that I consider< unacceptable E7>". He <declined to elaborate NS 7> but added that <there was "always hope" as talks were continuing C 11>.
They were set to focus on <securing a ceasefire C6>, <withdrawal of heavy weapons C6> and <creating a demilitarised zone C6>.
Russia has been accused of <arming and reinforcing pro-Russian rebels EGM 7,8,24> in eastern Ukraine - a claim it denies E17.
While the Ukrainian government is seeking a demarcation line based on the failed <ceasefire C6> agreed on 5 September in Belarus, the <rebels E7> want a new <truce C6> to reflect the gains they have made in recent weeks, the BBC's James Reynolds reports from Donetsk.
Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has offered Ukraine a $17.5bn <funding package C6> (£10.5bn; 15.5bn euros) to help the country's <struggling economy NSV2>.
Alongside other sources, this would reach $40bn over a four-year period, IMC chief Christine Lagarde said.

Netherlands vote on Ukraine cheers anti-EU camp
Although officially the Netherlands has rejected a landmark deal between the EU and Ukraine, in reality the issues that dominated this campaign were much wider.
The referendum was triggered by the <Eurosceptic movement LMU 7,24> which used a new law designed to <promote democracy C6> to force a vote by gathering enough signatures on a petition.
From the start, activists said this was a chance for voters in the country to express frustration at the EU ES 7, in particular what they see as its desire to expand despite <democratic shortcomings S24>.
Although the turnout was only narrowly above the 30% required to validate the result it has been hailed as a significant Eurosceptic victory.
One "No" campaigner at a results party in Amsterdam described it as a "slap in the face of the European monster AIJ 1,21".
In the UK Brexit activists were quick to claim the result showed <anti-EU sentiment ELMU 7,24> is growing despite the fact two-thirds of Dutch voters chose not to participate.
While a vote in the Netherlands may not widely shape public opinion in the UK, it will embolden those campaigning for the UK to leave the EU.
They will argue this result proves public concern over <sovereignty C11> and <accountability C 6,11> is shared beyond Britain.
But Netherlands voters were not asked to simply pass judgement on the EU, and throughout the campaign those promoting a "Yes" vote <were frustrated NS 7> by what they saw as attempts by Eurosceptics <to hijack a debate E 7,24> which should have been about relations between Ukraine, Russia and Europe.
Some say the multiple layers to this referendum means the result cannot be seen as a true reflection of the scale of euroscepticism in the Netherlands.
Nonetheless the country is traditionally a stronghold of European integration, and the rejection of this deal will <rattle the nerves of European leaders LMU 7,24> who are already struggling to <maintain unity C6> in the face of <economic instability EU 7,24> and the <migrant crisis EU 7,24>.
The impact of this on the Ukraine agreement is not yet clear. Although the referendum was not binding, Prime Minister Mark Rutte signalled the result would not be ignored and he would now open discussions with EU leaders about how to proceed.
Whatever the practical consequences, this referendum will be perceived and <paraded KM 7> by Eurosceptics as a symbol of growing support for their pertinent timing as the UK prepares <to decide its future relationship X 11,23> with the EU.

Analysts: Kiev needs <tensions EUF 5,7,8,19> in Donbas as excuse for <belt tightening BFM 2,7,8>  November 09, 2015, 19:46  UTC+3
MOSCOW, November 9. ,TASS,. As winter time is round the corner, the authorities in Kiev need a surge in <tensions EUF 5,8,24> in the southeast of Ukraine as an excuse for their <belt tightening BMF 2,7,8>policies, polled experts have told TASS in the wake of reports <<Ukrainian weapons EH 7,8> were being <moved closer EL 7>> to the disengagement line in Donbas.
At last Friday’s foreign minister level Normandy Quartet meeting in Berlin the negotiators discussed the <pullback of weapons QO 6,11>from the front line in the southeast of Ukraine. The foreign ministers stated that the <pullback of weapons QO 6,11> with calibers under 100 mm and <tanks BH 16> <was proceeding in accordance with the timetable QO 6> by and large. "This process is to be over by November 12," Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the media.
However, on Saturday the spokesman for the Defense Ministry of the <self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic EJ 7>, Eduard Basurin, said the <reconnaissance units A 23> had identified the arrival of a group of Ukrainian <self-propelled artillery BH 16>pieces and <tanks BH 16> at the engagement line in Donbas. "Last Saturday’s <strike BH 7,16> against Donetsk confirmed that in the Ukrainian armed forces there are certain people and units who are <against peace LM 7,8,24> and who have been trying to <provoke us into hostilities HL 7,14>by hook or by crook," Basurin said.
Analysts have emphasized the fact that the <redeployment of Ukrainian artillery A7> and <tanks H16> towards Donbas is underway on the eve of the November 15 local runoff elections. In the first round on October 25 the <ruling coalition failed KR 15> to score victories in one-third of the country’s regions and cities. In several major localities the <elections were disrupted altogether IJ14,24>.
The president of the Geopolitical Problems Academy, Konstantin Sivkov, believes that on the eve of the elections runoff, when the winter is about to set in with all the ensuing problems in the housing and utilities sector, Kiev <is desperate to find K9,E7,19> an <external enemy I7>.
"The <internal political strife LHF 7,8,14,24> in Kiev is gaining momentum. The <split E7> in the ruling coalition <is getting wider EL7>. The Petro Poroshenko Bloc does not rule out it may vote for a motion of no confidence in the Arseny Yatsenyuk government. In the meantime, ever more people tend to take to the streets to press for political demands. Naturally, a surge in <tensions EUF5,7,8,24> in Donbas would provide the authorities in Kiev with an excuse for <going ahead with austerity measures L13,16>" Sivkov told TASS.
The deputy director of the CIS Studies Institute, Vladimir Zharikhin, believes that the current situation on the line of disengagement in Donbas is not so much a military <aggravation BL 24> as a <propagandistic EU7> one. "When military people stay idle for too long, they tend to relax. In order <to keep them on the alert CU 1> both the <Donetsk Republic U25> and Kiev <have been exchanging counter-accusations E18,19>of <violating H7> the <weapons pullback regime C6>. There is no smoke without fire, though," Zharikhin told TASS.
According to his sources, Donetsk last weekend must have <come under a fire attack B,L 3,10> by <volunteer squads HML7,13,14,24> <beyond Kiev’s control E 19>. On November 8 the residents of a village <in the Kiev-controlled part E19> of the Donetsk Region complained to the authorities of the <Donetsk People’s Republic F7> about <rampaging marauders H7> from the <volunteer battalion Aidar HML 7,13,14,24>. "Last weekend’s <bombardments H7> may have been due to the same sort of <outbreaks of arbitrariness L7> locally. The very presence of <uncontrolled forces HL 7,16> in the <zone of the conflict HL7,16,24> in the southeast of Ukraine shows how <weak the vertical chain of command in Kiev J13,14,24> is. The authorities in Kiev should be aware that full compliance with the <<Minsk Accords C6> will be impossible L24> without the <establishment of full control C6> of the <volunteer squads of the Aidar type HLM 7,13,14>. But President Petro Poroshenko is mostly busy with the <struggle against the oligarchs CP 6>, such as Igor Kolomoisky and with <bolstering E7> his personal power," Zharikhin believes.
And the director of the Globalization Problems Institute, Mikhail Delyagin, sees certain <risks U7> the <armed HL7,8> standoff in the southeast of Ukraine may resume. "The Ukrainian regime <is unable to carry on without <war H7> KR15>. While <Russia as a member of the Normandy Quartet C`6> has been exerting every effort <to ensure the physical survival of people CT 6,11> in the Donetsk and Luhansk republics, West-leaning Kiev has been trying to strengthen its <armed H7> forces and subdue the <self-proclaimed republics EB 7>. To the accompaniment of speculations about compliance with the Minsk Accords the West has all the way put all the <blame EI 7> on Russia and <prolonged <sanctions E7>E 5,7,24> against it again and again."

Life on the <frontline E5> in Ukraine a year on from Minsk peace deal

http://www.euronews.com/2016/02/03/ukraine-life-in-the-village-of-zolotoe-3-in-the-luhansk-region/ 
The <scars of conflict EF5> run deep in eastern Ukraine and not just through the <ruined homes F5>. Zolotoe 3 is a village in the Luhansk region just two kilometres from the <front line LE 5> on the government-controlled side.
It is almost a year since the Minsk agreement to <resolve the crisis CT 6> and while the fighting has subsided life remains a <daily struggle A1, E5>.
Svetlana is a single mother and like many of her neighbours <without a job G10>. The factory where she used to work lies on the other side of the front line in the <self proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic E 4,7>.
“<I had to leave my job G10> in the <pro-Russian controlled territory E7> because it’s not accessible at the moment, that’s why we are staying here, and we can’t afford to leave. I hope that when <the war is over CW 11>, things will go back to the way they were. Ukraine will always be Ukraine. I don’t believe in anybody, neither Poroshenko, nor anyone else,” she told euronews.
The local Kindergarten is <deserted and closed F24>, <damaged by shelling JM 7,14>. Only 11 pupils attend the village’s primary school. Many who stayed when <the conflict E5> broke out were simply too old to leave.
“I just want people to come up with a common understanding so that <peace can return Q 11> and our <kindergarten can be rebuilt Q 11>. I still hear the children’s voices the director of the kindergarten said, her voice trembling at the memories.
In the <empty streets FV 24> and <ruined buildings FV 24> there is an unnerving silence and little activity.
Many of the villagers who fled at the height of <the conflict EF5> have returned because <they have nowhere else to go FG10>. However, most of them, who used to work at the local coal-mine, are now unemployed as it has closed down because of <the war E5>. They rely on assistance from NGOs and the UNHCR.
“There is also a <ceasefire C 6,11> since September which isn’t holding perfectly, but it’s holding enough for some families to perceive that they could come home. And in addition to that, unfortunately, there are many families who told us the main reason they came back is when they displaced to whichever city or town, <they weren’t able to find enough assistance FG 10> to get by,” said Jeff Wilkinson Head of UNHCR in Severdonetsk region.
According to the UNHCR there are now around 800 people living in the village. Before <the conflict E5> there was a population of 1200.
The UN agency provides what is called “winter non-food aid” to those that are in the village. There are blankets, clothes candles and coal as well as building supplies to help <repair the damaged buildings C6> as those that remain try <to rebuild their lives and their homes C 6,11,20>.
27.  Ukraine: <four dead H 3,7,10> as bus trips <mine E5> in divided Donetsk
http://www.euronews.com/2016/02/10/ukraine-bus-trips-mine-in-divided-donetsk-four-dead/

At least four people have been <killed FHV 5,10,16> after a bus <drove over a mine H5> in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.
Reports from the locality suggest the driver tried to manoeuvre around a checkpoint and drove into a field <detonating the explosive E5>.
Nineteen others have been <injured 10 EV>.
The <disputed and divided area EV5> controlled by both <pro-Russian separatists E 4,13,14> and the Ukrainian government is littered with checkpoints and ordnance.
One mother spoke of the daily drudgery:
“It’s scary, because we are <afraid B5> not only to go to the side of the road, but even step out onto the tarmac. The queues are <terrible B5>, <it’s unbearable E10>. Before we could skip the queue with the child, but now we have to wait for kilometres, dozens of kilometres, at a standstill.”
<<The battle E 5,24> for control of Donetsk continues ELV 5,24> with sporadic <clashes E 5> between government forces and <pro-Moscow militia>.
<The epicentre of the fighting ELV 5,24> is around the Donetsk airport.
A Ukranian platoon commander described the exchanges:“You hear how quiet it is now when the <shooting E 5> stops. Before they were <shooting E5> at us from 300 metres wIth automatic <weapons E 5>.”
Since the <conflict E 5> broke out in November 214 more than 9,000 people have been <killed  GH 5,7,24>.

28. Normal life in East Ukraine waits on demining efforts
http://www.euronews.com/2016/02/08/normal-life-in-east-ukraine-waits-on-demining-efforts/ 

Wednesday is the first anniversary of the Minsk agreement that was supposed to end the <crisis EL 5,16> between Ukraine and Russia. Mapping and clearing the <minefields E5> on the <frontline E5> is part of the deal. In the village of Syze people feel <under siege H24>.
“<Mine contamination BL 13,16> is another <huge problem E 5,16,24> of this area. For instance, this village is completely <surrounded by mines EF 5,10,16>,” says euronews’ Sergio Cantone.
Mines <stop the farmers from working EN5> their fields, and agriculture is virtually the only work around here, so until <the mines E5> are gone <normal life cannot resume JV 5,24>.
Foreign <NGOs can help CT6>, but only Ukrainian forces are allowed to actually demine. Some of the <minefields E5> are part of their defence system. One Danish NGO says <730 civilians have been killed HJ 10,24> by <mines E5> and <unexploded munitions E5>. And with the <frontline E 5> so close, there is still sporadic <shelling E5> and <sniper fire E5>. The mines <were laid in haste with no maps HL16>. <Fortunately Q 11> the locals <know where they are Q 11>.
“You can walk only on the paths not to the right, not to the left, not in the forest and not in the fields…We need our money not to go to Kyiv, but to the regions, such as Lviv, Donetsk, Luhansk. It’s not only about Donetsk and Luhansk it is also about the whole of Ukraine,” says Alexander, a strong supporter of the <federalisation of Ukraine EJM 5,7,21,24>.
The UNHCR is also here distributing aid to the last 13 villagers who have decided to brave out <the crisis EL 5,16> and stay put. They <need G24> warm clothes, food, and fuel, and are grateful for the <efforts C6> made by the Danes and British, Swiss and French demining charities.
“How much time has passed after WWII and <we still find mines EH 5>. So I don’t think that most of <landmines BE5> will be removed in a short period of time. My opinion is that they will keep finding them for quite a long time,” said a Ukrainian military nurse.
Now that <heavy regular fighting E5> has died down serious demining work can begin, but it is a risky business. Some of the <munitions E5> are decades old, some are new and contain no metal so are <hard to find B5,24>. And as the <bomb E5> experts say, “it’s <the ones you don’t find that you need to find the most NW 10,24> ”.

Ukraine’s EU bid: Dutch PM says <‘ratification can’t go ahead’ NSV 10>  as Kiev says <‘nothing has changed’  I 11>
Published time: 7 Apr, 2016 09:20
Ukraine says “nothing has changed” in Kiev’s desire to <“push towards the EU BEL 5”> despite <suffering a setback Q20> after the Dutch public <overwhelmingly voted against C 6> a <treaty on closer ties between the EU and Ukraine LM 12>, while the Dutch PM says <“ratification can’t go ahead.” NSV 24>
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte had been staunchly in favor of a ‘Yes’ vote, which would have led to the Netherlands approving an association treaty – <paving the way for closer ties LM 12> between the EU and Ukraine. However, <he was forced to take into account public opinion CP 6>, with 64 percent against the deal, and the government may have to reconsider ratifying the treaty. 
"It's clear that 'No' have won by an overwhelming margin, the question is only if <turnout is sufficient IU18 ,"> Rutte stated. "If the turnout is above 30 percent with such a large margin of victory for the 'No' camp then my sense is that ratification can't simply go ahead." 
<Closer integration with Europe LU 7> and giving its citizens visa-free travel across much of the continent has been one of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko’s major goals. Despite the <resounding rejection by the Dutch public GN 7>, the Ukrainian leader seemed <to be anything but <downbeat G 10>I 23>.
“The referendum in the Netherlands <was strictly in an advisory nature Q 11>. We will continue our movement towards the European Union,” he told reporters in Tokyo. "Under any circumstances we will continue to implement the association agreement with the European Union including a <deep and comprehensive free trade agreement C 17>" Poroshenko added.

You’ve consumed endless op-eds and profiles <white-washing EIK 5> Petro Poroshenko as some kind of <noble protector of <democratic values C6> R9> in the “New Ukraine.” You’ve also been exposed to <endless propaganda AJK 5> about <Ukraine’s “European choice” CO 6> and <misled E 18,27> to believe that the country is united in its desire to <re-orientate westward CO 6>.
By contrast, Russian media has consistently labeled Maidan, a <“coup JU 19>.” Lots and lots of folk on the Western think-tank circuit and opinion pages - which are often indivisible - are angry about that. They've long accused the Russians of trying <to hoodwink people AGJ 5>. ‘Weaponizing’ nouns, if you like.   
In reality, <the Russian media is right IKL 17>. Maidan was not a revolution. The term revolution implies that there was a dramatic structural shift in Ukraine. <But there wasn’t anything of the sort AJ 5>.  In a real transformation, the entire elite are replaced. For example, a new civil service is created and probably a fresh police force.

 ‘<Won’t help E2> ordinary Ukrainians’: Dutch suspect EU/Kiev deal <more for power players than people E2>
Published time: 6 Apr, 2016 05:54
Polls have opened on Wednesday in the Netherlands to see if the public wants to back an agreement to bring Ukraine closer to the EU. While <many Dutch people support ordinary Ukrainians CP 6>, a great number believe the proposed <deal will not help them IL 10, E 2>.
At The Hague, members of the “No” camp have been out <in force trying EI 5> to convince the general public not to vote in favor of the EU’s proposed association agreement with Kiev. Despite their efforts, however, even many of those opposing the deal have expressed an <underlying desire to help Ukraine’s general population CP6>.
“This [treaty] <will not help the ordinary citizen E2> in Ukraine,” Harry van Bommel, an MP with the Socialist Party, told RT. <“It will help the oligarchs AJ 5>., it will help Poroshenko and it will help the others. I <am willing C6> and the Dutch <are willing to help Ukrainians C6>, but we can do that through neighborhood policy and all sorts of funds that are available already,” he added.  
Many Dutch people have voiced concern as to just <how ordinary Ukrainians would benefit C10> from the association agreement. Though the pact would essentially give Ukrainians visa-free travel within the vast majority of the EU, it would also <break down free trade barriers C6>, which, according to Jan Roos from the GeenStjil (No Style) magazine, would be of <little benefit NI 24> to the vast majority of those living in Ukraine.  
<“There is no trade between the Netherlands and Ukraine N 24>. The Ukrainian people are <very poor G10> so they <can’t buy our tulips or our cheese KR 9,”> Roos explained. “But <I want the best for the Ukrainian people C6> and I want them to <live in peace CQ 11>. There <is a war going on there BGL 24>, which <was caused by this association agreement IJN 22.”>

Ukraine's Politics <Descend Into Slapstick JS7/21>
DEC 15, 2015 1:23 PM EST
Less than a week after U.S. Vice President Joe Biden asked Ukraine's political leaders to play nice, the quiet <war L5> between the teams of Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and President Petro Poroshenko has <turned publicly and comically violent KL 25>.
The situation is growing increasingly reminiscent of Ukraine's previous attempt to break with Russia's dominance and embark on a European path. From 2005 to 2010, then President Viktor Yuschenko's faction clashed repeatedly with that of Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, <rampant corruption JS7,16> <undermined the economy LN 7,10,16> and <reforms proved fake MS 18>. This led to the election of President Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted last year in a <bloody uprising HG 10/16>. 
Biden's plea was timed to preempt a crucial moment: On Dec. 11, Yatsenyuk's year-long immunity from dismissal as prime minister expired, rendering him vulnerable to political attack. Biden warned Poroshenko that Ukraine's Western allies want to avoid the <political upheaval M7> that Yatsenyuk's firing would entail. Without the support of the prime minister's faction -- the second biggest in parliament -- the ruling coalition <would fall apart L7>, triggering an <early election E2>. The resulting campaigning could sideline reforms, <sorely L 16> testing the patience of <impoverished G,L 10,16> and often <armed L 13,16> voters.  
On Dec. 12, Yatsenyuk was defending his government's record in parliament when legislator Oleg Barna, a member of the presidential faction, approached him with a bunch of flowers. Nonplussed, Yatsenyuk took the bouquet. Barna then lifted him up in a body lock and attempted to drag him from the rostrum. Yatsenyuk clung to it, so Barna changed his grip, seizing the prime minister between his legs. Legislators from the Yatsenyuk party were already running to intercept Barna <like a rugby team in suits K 15>. Soon, <fists were flying all over the floor IJM7/9>. Many Ukrainian legislators <have risen through the ranks in mob-controlled coal and steel towns E18>, and their Brioni attire <is only a thin veneer K 9,18>.
"Possibly, <this wasn't a very European way to act, but I couldn't do otherwise W 17>," Barna later explained. <"If he won't leave of his own accord, people will carry him out" L,W 17>.
That's not all. On Monday, Poroshenko called together his National Reform Council. According to some reports, his aim was to follow Biden's advice, erase the <Barna incident M 7> and announce that he was going to work together with Yatsenyuk. <It didn't turn out that way S7>.
One participant was Mikheil Saakashvili, former president of Georgia and now the Poroshenko-appointed governor of the Odessa region in Ukraine, who earlier this month accused Yatsenyuk of involvement in <financial schemes E 18,19> that, he claimed, <drained J 4> $5 billion a year from Ukraine's coffers. Saakashvili's presence <angered E7> Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, a Yatsenyuk ally. According to an account he posted on Facebook, Avakov asked Saakashvili about a recently <leaked video I 18,19> purporting to show a <secret meeting U18> between the governor and a Russian businessman interested in buying an Odessa chemical factory.
"The Odessa governor <grew hysterical E,K 9,21> and started screaming at me," Avakov wrote. "I refrained from hitting him and <splashed some water in his face A 1,21>." The minister went on to call the governor "a <militant scumbag J17/19> who is looking for a pretext to <resign with a loud bang E9>, <having failed in his job E 7,18>"
Saakashvili's <version is, of course, different K9 >. He gave a press conference after the incident, claiming that Avakov <got mad E 9,18> after the governor openly called Yatsenyuk and his team <corrupt SE13/14>, that Avakov "attempted <to toss a glass at him A,L 18>" and <demanded that he leave "their country A 14>." "I am here with serious intentions and for the long haul," Saakashvili said, holding up his recently acquired Ukrainian passport. "I'm not going to leave them alone."
Both Avakov and Saakashvili demanded that Poroshenko's administration release a video of the meeting, which had been filmed. Presidential spokesman Svatoslav Tsegolko refused. "Such <street-style altercations W2> <disgrace J19/14> the country," he wrote on Facebook. He was not alone in his embarrassment. "What is going on is truly a <shame ZJ 19/14>, a <disgrace JZ 2, 14,19>, a <paucity J19/14> of both spirit and ideas," Volodymyr Omelyan, who resigned last week as deputy transport minister, wrote angrily. "I'd resign again today if I could."
<Bureaucrats E 4> drafted from the private sector after Ukraine's "<Revolution of Dignity 24 C>" are probably tempted to leave, too. Some, though, are trying to keep calm and carry on. "The government has been accused of <corruption J19/14>, and it denies the charges," said Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko, a U.S. citizen responsible for Ukraine's debt reduction deal with private creditors. "Though this is a coalition government, we work as one team. Don't try to split it."
Poroshenko can't say the same, even though he should. If he openly backs Yatsenyuk, Saakashvili may revolt and challenge him. The explosive Georgian <is popular in Ukraine C6>, and <has more political experience C6>. The president would probably prefer Saakashvili to Yatsenyuk as prime minister. Siding with the Odessa governor, though, would mean ousting Yatsenyuk , triggering an <early election E2> and <irritating M8> the U.S., where Yatsenyuk and Jaresko are popular figures.
Russian President <<Vladimir Putin's minions K9> are enjoying the showK 15>. <"The spiders are beginning to devour each other R9,15>" Alexei Pushkov, head of the Russian parliament's  foreign affairs committee, tweetedon Tuesday. A <dysfunctional SE24>, <scandal-ridden SE24> Ukrainian government <is just what Putin needs L9>. Unfortunately, the combatants appear to be past caring. Saakashvili <sees himself as a fearless anti-corruption crusader K 9>, though he <hasn't accused anyone on Porosheko's team of graft I 18,23> despite numerous opportunities. Yatsenyuk is trying to keep his job and defend his record. Poroshenko <is torn between remaining on good terms with the U.S. and consolidating power 5,10>. 
If this <circus R9> continues, <another revolt could break out L 12>. The politicians in Kiev ought to realize that the whole country is watching. Their <primitive aggression EM 7,16> and <venality E 7,18> could quickly become too much to endure.

Ukraine Needs <the IMF's Tough Love K9> 
FEB 12, 2016 2:00 AM EST
The International Monetary Fund has threatened <to cut off aid E,L 5,7> to Ukraine unless the government finally cracks down on <corruption JS7/13>. It’s the right message, and the fund should be prepared <to follow through L6> <if President Petro Poroshenko fails to deliver L7>.
Make no mistake: This would be <a devastating blow B 3,12> for a country still struggling with a <Russia-inspired insurgency J 7,13> in its eastern provinces. The IMF-led $40 billion aid program <is keeping Ukraine’s economy alive C 6,10>, <if just barely L10>.
The <unfortunate truth KG 10,18> is, independent Ukraine has so far shown itself <incapable of reform E18>. It’s been almost two years since former President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted (and <Russia, in response, annexed Crimea E7>). With the conflict in the eastern Donbas region now merely simmering, <the greatest threat to Ukraine’s continued existence as an independent state is its own corruption L,E 7,16>.
The country’s persistent <vulnerability L 13> to this problem has inspired two popular <uprisings MW 7,13>, in 2004 and 2013. And <corruption E 7,16>, <especially in the energy field E 7,16>, is what has exposed the country to <manipulation J 7,13> -- and, later, <invasion LH 3,12> -- by Russia. 
So what to do? After IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde issued her <threat L 13>, Poroshenko promised to deliver a <road map to reform C 6,23>. It should include at least three proposals.
First, Ukraine needs an enforceable schedule for the <privatizing C6> most of the country’s 3,000-plus state-owned companies, whose <losses <are bleeding H 13> the budget dry E7>. Under the country’s post-Soviet system, the profits these companies earn are privatized, but assets and losses remain the responsibility of the state. So, <oligarchs E 13,21> pay <stooges E 21> in parliament and government ministries to ensure that their people are put in charge of state enterprises. These <appointees E 13,21>, in turn, can <siphon revenues to their bosses E,K 7,9> -- and <pass losses on to the state E,K 7>. 
Naturally, it will take time to sell so many companies. In the meantime, Ukraine should form an independent committee of <technocrats C6> <to cull corrupt managers C6> and <replace them with professionals C6>. 
Also, special prosecutors, who at last are being hired to work with the new <National Anti-Corruption Bureau C6>, need <to be protected from interference C6,11>, so that <corrupt officials E7/13/21> can be <brought to trial C6>. Ideally their trials will be held before special corruption courts run by judges from outside Ukraine’s compromised judiciary -- if need be, from abroad.
Poroshenko must understand that Ukraine <has reached a tipping point L,F 24,25>. Its Western donors are <running out of patience L 25>, and so are some of its own leaders. Earlier this month, Aivaras Abromavicius, the reformist economy minister, resigned, protesting that <he could no longer <act as a “smokescreen” EK 7> EK 5,24> for <malfeasance JE7/13/21>, including <meddling E7/13/21> in state enterprise appointments by a legislator who is a close business associate of Poroshenko’s. Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko and other technocrats who had hoped to produce change are also threatening to resign.  
Poroshenko’s promised road map will need to satisfy Western donors and reformist ministers alike. Indeed, the proposals it contains should be solid enough to persuade Abromavicius to return to his job. No one is in a better position to judge whether the government is getting serious about reform.

Ukrainian government <survives no-confidence vote amid infighting U23>
Motion falls short of the 226 votes required to oust the cabinet, as President Petro Poroshenko calls on PM to resign
The Ukrainian government has <survived a no-confidence vote U23>, despite severe criticism from a majority of MPs.
The <vote reflected political tensions L23> amid <economic problemsG10> that have <eroded public support L10,7> for the cabinet of prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. The failure to pass the parliamentary motion reflected <MPs’ fears F10> that it could cause the <collapse of the ruling coalition LU24> and lead to early elections.
President Petro Poroshenko had earlier called on the embattled prime minister to resign and for a new cabinet to be appointed.
“The tension between the government and the factions has become so high that <it poses a threat L25> to the coalition’s functioning,” Poroshenko said in a statement.
Yatsenyuk defended his cabinet’s performance during <a raucous debateU4>, saying that “hatred and anger are not emotions which should unite the political class”.
The motion received 194 votes, falling short of the 226 required to oust the cabinet.
Poroshenko and Yatsenyuk <are keen to avoid snap elections LE4> because both of their parties have fallen in recent opinion polls as <public frustration has mountedC6> with the <government’s lack of progressE4>. The blocs led by the prime minister and the presidential faction are the largest in parliament and they – along with a collection of other political fractions – have been< in a tug-of-war for influenceE7>.
Yatsenyuk became prime minister after the country’s Russia-friendly president was chased from power in February 2014 following massive protests. Poroshenko was elected several months later with widespread support and a seal of approval from western leaders.
However, a <string of very public spatsW24> between Ukrainian lawmakers, often involving members of Yatsenyuk’s and Poroshenko’s blocs, have strained the public patience and <eroded the confidence J7,8> of the west.
Last week, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde <threatened to halt U23> the delivery of Ukraine’s $17.5bn <aid package C6> that the country is counting on <to keep the economy afloatC6>. 
35. http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/10/imf-warns-ukraine-halt-40bn-bailout-corruption-christine-lagarde
The International Monetary Fund <has warned it will halt its $40bn ILU23,25> (£28bn) bailout programme to Ukraine unless the <conflict-torn eastern European countryG10> takes immediate action <to tackle corruptionC6>.
The IMF’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said on Wednesday that “without a substantial new effort” to improve governance,< it was hard to see howU25> the Washington-based organisation could continue to provide financial help.
“<I am concerned L7> about Ukraine’s <slow progress E7> in improving governance and fighting corruption, and reducing the influence of vested interests in policymaking,” she said.
“Without a substantial new effort to invigorate governance reforms and fight corruption, it is hard to see how the IMF-supported programme can continue and be successful. Ukraine <risks a return to the pattern of failed economic policiesU10> that <has plagued its recent historyG10>. It is vital that Ukraine’s leadership acts now to put the country back on a promising path of reform.”
Lagarde’s comments follow the resignation last week of Ukraine’s economic minister, Aivaras Abromavičius, after he accused a senior aide to the country’s president, Petro Poroshenko, of <blocking anti-corruption reforms E7>.
The IMF’s programme involves disbursing money in stages and has always been contingent on economic and political reforms. A <third tranche of assistance has been held up U25> since October because IMF officials have grown increasingly concerned that the financial <assistance would be squandered or stolen L,U7,16,21> by <corrupt officials E7> .
Latest figures, for the third quarter of 2015, show the Ukrainian economy contracting at an annual rate of more than 7%, and IMF <support has been vital C6> in preventing a bigger collapse in output and in brokering a debt relief deal with investors.
But <interest rates on Ukrainian bonds have risen sharply L25> and the currency, the hryvnia, was trading close to a one-year low against the US dollar.
Responding to the IMF statement, Pavlo Klimkin, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said: “I do not consider it as a warning but as a message. Our IMF programme is <critical for us C6> - the main task and challenge is to make the whole system of tackling corruption operational and effective. It has just started. You cannot expect it to work over days but we don’t have time to develop the system over years and years.”

Ukraine pilot Nadia Savchenko expecting guilty verdict in trial for <murdering B7,14> Russian journalists
8:57AM GMT 21 Mar 2016
A <Russian judge J7> on Monday began reading the verdict of Nadia Savchenko, a <Ukrainian army officer K10>, who is expected to be found guilty of <murdering B7,14> two Russian journalists during a battle in Ukraine in 2014 in a case condemned by Western governments as a <show trial R7>. 
<Miss Savchenko C6> is <accused of directing a mortar strike E7> that <killed B,E7> Anton Voloshin and Igor Kornelyuk, employees of Russia’s VGTRK state broadcaster, during a battle north of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine on June 17, 2014. 
In opening remarks on, judge Leonid Stepanenko said <Miss Savchenko C6> “acted as part of a group, by prior agreement and conscious of the consequences, with the aim of <killing an unlimited number of people B,H 3,7,14>,” and was motivated by “political <hatred A1>.” 
Mark Feygin and Nikolai Polezov, <Miss Savchenko's C6> defence lawyers, said the remarks were a summary of the prosecution case and not part of the actual ruling, which is expected to be delivered on Tuesday 
"It will be a guilty verdict, of course," Mr Feygin told journalists. "Today, as before, we are <convinced of Nadezhda Savchenko's innocence C6 >, we have proved <her innocent C6>," he said. 
Under Russian law, judges <read detailed and lengthy summaries of court cases K9> before passing sentence. <Judge Stepanenko J13  ?> spoke for more than eight hours on Monday, before adjourning until Tuesday morning. 
Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of 23 years in prison for <Miss Savchenko C6>, who is also facing a simultaenous charge <of crossing the border into Russia illegally E7>. The trial is being held in Donetsk, a small border town in Russia's Rostov region which borders <separatist-held territory E7> in Ukraine. 
<Miss Savchenko C6>, who has called the proceedings a "<farce ER 18,21>,"< denies all the charges against her C6,17> and maintains she <<was captured by separatist fighters A13> an hour before the journalists <were killed B,E7>J17> and <was brought into Russia against her will G,J17> <as a prisoner G,J 17,24> of Russian intelligence operatives. 
She said via her legal team that <she will go on <a "dry" hunger strike E7,H5> G,H5> - which <includes refusing water E7,H5> - if a guitly verdict is delivered as expected.  
<Miss Savchenko C6> is a <Ukrainian army helicopter pilot C6>, but was fighting as an infantryman in a pro-Kiev militia called Aidar battalion when she < was captured by <pro-Russian separatist fighters E7>E,J 10,17 > in June 2014. She was later handed over to Russia where she was put on trial for the <deaths B3,7> of two journalists who <died B,E7>  on the same day <she was captured E,J 10,17 >. 
The case has emerged as a <diplomatic flashpoint in the ongoing confrontation A8> between Russia and Ukraine, where she has been hailed as <a national hero C6,20> who <is being used by the Kremlim as a <hostage B,L10>B,G,J10 >. 
The Ukrainian and Western governments have repeatedly <called on Russia to release her C6 >, saying that her <detention E7> is <indefensible E,J7 >. 
Since she was <imprisoned E7> she has been elected a <member of parliament O20> and made a <Hero of Ukraine O20>, the country’s highest state decoration, by president Petro Poroshenko. 
<Mr Poroshenko C6> has repeatedly demanded her released, and appeared to claim he had secured a promise to do so from Vladimir Putin during <peace talks C 6,11> in Minsk in February 2015. 
<The Kremlin L7> denied any such deal had been made, and Russian officials have since explicitly said Miss Savchenko is not subject to the part of the Minsk agreement requiring <release of prisoners C6> because she is being held as a <suspected felon B,E7,16>, <not a prisoner of war E7>. 
<Western leaders C6>, including Barack Obama and Angela Merkel, have also called for her <release C6>.  
Mr Feygin, <Miss Savchenko's  C6> lawyer, has previously said that she is only likely to be released as part of a high-level <political deal T15> between the Kremlin and Kiev. 
Earlier on Monday he appeared to hint that such a deal may already be under discussion, saying she would soon be <"going home C 6,11"> .
“The Savchenko verdict <will be guilty E7>, and she’ll get a long sentence. But <Nadia is going home soon CO 6,11>,” he tweeted before the court session began. 
Ukraine has proposed exchanging her for two Russian <special forces officers A1> captured in eastern Ukraine last year. Russia has so far rebuffed that proposal, but some followers of the trial have suggested that Moscow may be prepared <to cut a deal T15> once <she has been found guilty E,J7>. 

34.     Russia and Ukraine discuss prisoner transfers
4:04PM GMT 11 Mar 2016
Ukraine has asked Russia to repatriate several <high-profile prisoners E7>, <raising hopes C11> for an exchange that could <free C,O11> controversial detainees caught up in the confrontation between the two countries.  The Russian ministry of justice confirmed on Friday that it has received a request <to repatriate C6> four Ukrainians serving jail terms in <Russian jails AE 7>. Meanwhile, it said the two countries are separately considering appeals from 13 <Russians jailed in Ukraine E7> to serve out sentences <in their home country C11>. 
“The Russian and Ukrainian justice ministries are currently looking at the transfer of 13 <Russian citizens E14>, sentenced by <Ukrainian courts C6>, to serve out the rest of their sentences in Russian territory,” the ministry said. 
The ministry said it would take 30 days to consider the Ukrainian request, and that any <repatriation C6> would be carried out under the 1983 convention on the transfer of sentenced prisoners.  Friday’s statement came a day after Aseniy Yatsenyuk,     the Ukrainian prime minister , said he had ordered justice officials to inform the families of Oleg Sentsov, Yury Soloshenko, Alexander Kolchenko, and Gennady Afanasyev, about <plans to bring them home Q11>. 
The four men were jailed last year on what critics say were <fabricated charges of <terrorism B3,E7>E,J 7> designed to <punish them for being <pro-Ukrainian activists C6>E7>.  Mr Sentsov, Mr Kolchenko, and Mr Afanasyev were <arrested E7> in their native Crimea in May 2014 and <accused of organising <terror attacks B,H3> E7>  against <pro-Russian groups J7> in region, which had been <<annexed from Ukraine E7> by <Russian troops J7> EJ7> two months earlier.   
They <denied the charges C17>, saying they have been prosecuted for their support of the Maidan revolutionary movement that <overthrew A7> Viktor Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine, in February 2014.  Mr Sentsov, an up-and-coming film maker, and Mr Kolchenko, <an anarchist political activist J14>, received 20 and 10 years respectively.  Mr Afanasyev, who originally <testified against his co-accused E7> before withdrawing his testimony, saying it had been <extracted under duress EM 8,7>, was sentenced to seven years. 
Mr Soloshenko, the 73-year old former director of a Ukrainian defence factory, was jailed for six years in October for attempting <to smuggle missile components EJ 4,14> out of Russia.  Ukraine holds several high profile Russian prisoners, including Alexander Aleksandrov and Yevgeny Yerofeyev, two <self-confessed members of the GRU E13>, Russia’s military intelligence agency who were captured in east Ukraine in May last year.  Although the prisoners in question to not include Nadia Savchenko, the Ukrainian army officer <charged with murder B,E7>, her lawyers have said that they hope she may eventually <be released in similar deal T24>. 
Mark Feygin, a lawyer for Ms Savchenko, said it was premature to say whether there is <deal forming T24> to resolve the case of Mr Sentsov and others.  “If here is some kind of deal, however, it would obviously be a <very healthyC6> and <positive thing C6>,” he said by telephone. “I think Nadia’s only chance of getting home would be in <a political decision Q11> probably involving a similar exchange,” he added.

Since she was <imprisoned E7> she has been elected a <member of parliament O20> and made a <Hero of Ukraine O20>, the country’s highest state decoration, by president Petro Poroshenko. 
<Mr Poroshenko C6> has repeatedly demanded her released, and appeared to claim he had secured a promise to do so from Vladimir Putin during <peace talks C 6,11> in Minsk in February 2015. 
<The Kremlin L7> denied any such deal had been made, and Russian officials have since explicitly said Miss Savchenko is not subject to the part of the Minsk agreement requiring <release of prisoners C6> because she is being held as a <suspected felon B,E7,16>, <not a prisoner of war E7>. 
<Western leaders C6>, including Barack Obama and Angela Merkel, have also called for her <release C6>.  
Mr Feygin, <Miss Savchenko's  C6> lawyer, has previously said that she is only likely to be released as part of a high-level <political deal T15> between the Kremlin and Kiev. 
Earlier on Monday he appeared to hint that such a deal may already be under discussion, saying she would soon be <"going home C 6,11"> .
“The Savchenko verdict <will be guilty E7>, and she’ll get a long sentence. But <Nadia is going home soon CO 6,11>,” he tweeted before the court session began. 
Ukraine has proposed exchanging her for two Russian <special forces officers A1> captured in eastern Ukraine last year. Russia has so far rebuffed that proposal, but some followers of the trial have suggested that Moscow may be prepared <to cut a deal T15> once <she has been found guilty E,J7>. 


36.      Russia and Ukraine discuss prisoner transfers
4:04PM GMT 11 Mar 2016
Ukraine has asked Russia to repatriate several <high-profile prisoners E7>, <raising hopes C11> for an exchange that could <free C,O11> controversial detainees caught up in the confrontation between the two countries.  The Russian ministry of justice confirmed on Friday that it has received a request <to repatriate C6> four Ukrainians serving jail terms in <Russian jails AE 7>. Meanwhile, it said the two countries are separately considering appeals from 13 <Russians jailed in Ukraine E7> to serve out sentences <in their home country C11>. 
“The Russian and Ukrainian justice ministries are currently looking at the transfer of 13 <Russian citizens E14>, sentenced by <Ukrainian courts C6>, to serve out the rest of their sentences in Russian territory,” the ministry said. 
The ministry said it would take 30 days to consider the Ukrainian request, and that any <repatriation C6> would be carried out under the 1983 convention on the transfer of sentenced prisoners.  Friday’s statement came a day after Aseniy Yatsenyuk,     the Ukrainian prime minister , said he had ordered justice officials to inform the families of Oleg Sentsov, Yury Soloshenko, Alexander Kolchenko, and Gennady Afanasyev, about <plans to bring them home Q11>. 
The four men were jailed last year on what critics say were <fabricated charges of <terrorism B3,E7>E,J 7> designed to <punish them for being <pro-Ukrainian activists C6>E7>.  Mr Sentsov, Mr Kolchenko, and Mr Afanasyev were <arrested E7> in their native Crimea in May 2014 and <accused of organising <terror attacks B,H3> E7>  against <pro-Russian groups J7> in region, which had been <<annexed from Ukraine E7> by <Russian troops J7> EJ7> two months earlier.   
They <denied the charges C17>, saying they have been prosecuted for their support of the Maidan revolutionary movement that <overthrew A7> Viktor Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine, in February 2014.  Mr Sentsov, an up-and-coming film maker, and Mr Kolchenko, <an anarchist political activist J14>, received 20 and 10 years respectively.  Mr Afanasyev, who originally <testified against his co-accused E7> before withdrawing his testimony, saying it had been <extracted under duress EM 8,7>, was sentenced to seven years. 
Mr Soloshenko, the 73-year old former director of a Ukrainian defence factory, was jailed for six years in October for attempting <to smuggle missile components EJ 4,14> out of Russia.  Ukraine holds several high profile Russian prisoners, including Alexander Aleksandrov and Yevgeny Yerofeyev, two <self-confessed members of the GRU E13>, Russia’s military intelligence agency who were captured in east Ukraine in May last year.  Although the prisoners in question to not include Nadia Savchenko, the Ukrainian army officer <charged with murder B,E7>, her lawyers have said that they hope she may eventually <be released in similar deal T24>. 
Mark Feygin, a lawyer for Ms Savchenko, said it was premature to say whether there is <deal forming T24> to resolve the case of Mr Sentsov and others.  “If here is some kind of deal, however, it would obviously be a <very healthyC6> and <positive thing C6>,” he said by telephone. “I think Nadia’s only chance of getting home would be in <a political decision Q11> probably involving a similar exchange,” he added. 
Lieutenant Savchenko, 34, denies <murdering B,E7> two Russian journalists in a battle in east Ukraine in June 2014. A Russian court is expected <to pass sentence J4> in her case on March 20 and 21.

1)German and French foreign ministers <urge E7> Ukraine to push reform program
The foreign ministers of France and Germany have <urged E7> Ukraine to continue its program of reforms and <to fight against <corruption C1,6>>.The ministers are making a joint trip to Kyiv ahead of talks with Russia next week.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault flew in to Berlin to review foreign affairs with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier before the two men set off for Kyiv on Monday.
Fluent German-speaker Ayrault was only appointed to the Foreign Ministry earlier this month after Laurent Fabius was named as head of France's Constitutional Council, the body which ensures laws comply with the constitution. The 66-year-old Ayrault served as French prime minister from 2012 to 2014 but has never served in a diplomatic role.
In Berlin, Ayrault <hailed Germany's "courage"C6> in <opening its borders to <refugees GLU10>  LU10>, saying "The German people are acting with a <courage C6> that <invites respect C6>."
He added that both Paris and Berlin wished to "<improve the control of refugees C6> and " France plans to accept 30,000 refugees , while Germany took in more than a million last year. 
Joint approach toward Ukraine
Berlin and Paris have led efforts to end the <conflict EL 7> in Ukraine that has claimed more than 9,000 lives in fighting between <pro-Russian rebels EL 13,16> and government troops in the east of the country. But the Minsk II peace plan signed last year expired at the end of 2015 with few of its provisions met.
A high-ranking Ukrainian diplomat told the AFP news agency that the visit represented "a very serious signal that France will continue being an active player in attempts to find a settlement" to Kyiv's <22-month conflict EHL5>with <pro-Russian rebels AU 7,13>.
On their arrival in Kyiv on Monday evening, Steinmeier and Ayrault met with representatives of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which monitors a ceasefire agreement in the east of Ukraine, according to the German Foreign Ministry.
The French Foreign Ministry called the visit to Ukraine by Steinmeier and Ayrault "an opportunity to take stock with the Ukrainian authorities on the progress of reforms and the implementation of the Minsk accord."
"In return for our solidarity and support, we rely on the affirmation of political powers in Ukraine to continue the course of reforms," Ayrault and Steinmeier wrote in a statement published in Monday's edition of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung."
The ministers said Ukraine was in urgent need of reforms and called on politicians to <"remain true to the spirit of Maidan C6,11">. The second anniversary of the protests directed at the former <pro-Russian regime  EU5,16> was marked with a number of commemorations over the weekend.
Ukraine's pro-Western coalition lost its legislative majority in parliament last week.
"A return on the road to reform is important," Steinmeier told a joint press conference with Ayrault before their departure for Kyiv on Monday.
"We come to Ukraine in the midst of <a political crisis ES5,8>" said Ayrault, but added: "We will support Ukraine."
The two ministers are due to meet Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin on Tuesday before departing later in the day.
Ukraine and Russia are due to meet in Paris next week for talks intended to <revive the Minsk <ceasefire C6,11> agreement C6,11>.

http://www.dw.com/en/russian-rebel-fights-for-our-land-in-ukraine/a-18555045
Bound by a feeling of duty to the place he was born, Sergei left his family and comfortable life in Germany <to fight with the pro-Russia rebels CT1,6,20> in eastern Ukraine. Kitty Logan reports from the front line.

Russian-born Sergei, who goes by the military code name "Krest," crouches down by a metal railing on a bridge overlooking an open field. This is the <rebel AL 13,16> front line near Yasynuvata, not far from the strongly-contested area surrounding Donetsk airport. It is a major <flashpoint L 16>, where <fighting L5> flares up almost daily. Sergei points to Ukrainian government positions in the fields towards the nearby town of Avdiivka. Below the bridge is a neat row of sandbagged bunkers, dotted evenly along a bank of earth, each manned by <rebel fighters AL 13,16> from the Vostok battalion, <weapons ready L1>. Further forward in the field, another line of soldiers faces Ukrainian government troops at close range. These are permanent positions, the two sides firmly entrenched and locked down in the same location for months; watching, waiting - and often <exchanging fire LU5, 16>.
Earlier sporadic gunfire paused, to be temporarily replaced with an eerie, tense silence. There is no sign of life here, other than the soldiers burrowed away deep in their fortifications. No civilians pass by, and what used to be a busy ring road to the airport is utterly deserted. There are not even any animals grazing in the fields. Sergei is keen <to open fire on the Ukrainian forces ALU 1,5,7,13>, in revenge for the previous outburst. And so it starts up again, with a relentless <barrage of small-arms fire AB 1,16>. Within a minute, the return fire whizzes past us and Sergei dives into a trench. He screams out at his troops <to hold fire AB 1,16>. But there is no sense of alarm at the <attack A1>.  
"They shoot at us every day," Sergei says, slightly out of breath after the short, but intense <firefight A1,16>. "Day and night. There's no calm." As he speaks this another bullet flies past and he ducks into a bunker.
Born in USSR
It is no easy life for front-line soldiers on either side of this conflict, nor has Sergei chosen the easy option. He gave up a comfortable existence in Germany, where he lived for 25 years, to fight for the pro-Russia rebels in eastern Ukraine.
"My mother is German. I have family in Germany. I have two children, a son and a daughter," he explains. "My parents also live in Germany. I had a business there. I closed it down and came here to help."
Sergei is now a squadron leader for this unit of the Donetsk-based Vostok battalion. He feels <it is his patriotic duty to fight C6,17>. "I'm Russian. I was born in the USSR. My father is Russian. <I have to fight A1>. These are my people," he says. "But I <have no ill feeling towards Germany C6>. <Germany is a good country C6> - <everything is OK C6> there, the laws, the life for children."
Though he was born in Russia, Sergei insists he is not part of the Russian army. He says he learned to handle weapons in Kazakhstan, where he grew up. "There's no <Russian army AU13> here," he says. "It's the people who live here [<who are fighting A1>]. They want <to live on their own land C6,17>, <in their own city C6>."
Obeying Minsk
Sergei and his soldiers pull back to a nearby checkpoint, as <fighting A1> quickly escalates from gunfire to <exchanges of rocket-propelled grenades  A1,B3>. A <mortar hits nearby BH 3> and the troops start to prepare <automatic grenades and rocket launchers AB 1>. For them, <there is no ceasefire A1,E7>. The latest Minsk agreement, which came into force last February, is simply holding back an advance, even though Sergei admits the <rebel A1,13> front line has crept forward by almost two kilometers since the deal came into force. "<We're waiting for a command AL1>," says Sergei. "If there's a command to advance, then we'll go further. But <we have to obey the Minsk agreement C6>."  
Sergei says <he is not worried Q6> about taking on Ukrainian government troops in <close combat AL 1,16> on the <battlefield A1>, despite the fact they are now better trained and equipped than they were before, <thanks to assistance C6,19> from the US, British and Canadian military.
"No one can beat Russians," he says.
But he would like to see <a peaceful resolution to the conflict COP6,11>. "<We don't want war C6,17>. <We want calm CQ 6,11,17>, <we want peace CQ 6,11,17 >, because many <children are dying EGN5,8,10>. <People here also don't want war C6,17>. We want <to find a peaceful solution C6,17 > between the two sides, <without anymore fighting C6,17>. Maybe (Ukrainian President) Poroshenko will reconsider and <leave us in peace CQ 6,11,17>. <We don't want to continue with the bloodshed C6,17>. But if he [Poroshenko] doesn't want that and won't listen to us,  then < we'll carry on fighting A1,17>. And <we'll take what belongs to us A1,17>."
The <fighting intensifies A1,5> around the checkpoint as he <calmly Q6> drinks a cup of coffee and smokes a cigarette. Then Sergei climbs into his green flat-bed truck to make the high-speed, high-adrenalin dash away, down the deserted highway, his foot flat on the accelerator <to avoid sniper fire AL1>. A portrait of Stalin, watches out for him from the back window. But despite his strong sense of Soviet pride, Sergei says he wants to return to Germany once the war is over, even though he does not know when that will be. "I don't know what will happen here," he says. "But we're going further. We're advancing. <That's our land A 1,17>."

<'Be strong, you are not alone,' QT20> Paris <attacks victims B10> offer <hope CQ11> to people of Brussels
By Erin McLaughlin, John Fiegener and Bryony Jones, CNN
Updated 1238 GMT (1938 HKT) March 31, 2016

Paris (CNN)Emmanuel Domenach's life changed forever on November 13 last year. He was at theBataclan in Paris with friends, enjoying a drink and watching the Eagles of Death Metal perform, when shots began <to ring out LU5>around him.
At first he thought it was some <sort of sick prank IJ5,7>. Then <came the screams BL5>. And as his fellow music fans fell to the ground, Domenach's survival instinct kicked in.
"I got down and I said to myself, 'OK, the only thing you have to do is hide your head, and if you're <injured LG 10,24> you'll be injured LG 10,24 on your arms or your legs and <it will be OK CQ 6,11>, <you will survive BFH11,25> ... I put <blood BL 3> on my head and my arms ... [to <make it look like] I am dead  BFL1,6>. Maybe it will work."
<He was finally able to escape Q25> when the gunmen moved away to another part of the venue. Others <were not so lucky G10>; 89 <people died ABG7,14>at the Bataclan, and another 41 <were killed BGH1,16> at sites across the city, as <terrorists AB 1,16> <stalked the streets L12> of Paris.
"Afterwards, one of the special forces [personnel] came up and said 'You were really<braveC6>, what I saw in the Bataclan was the <most awful thing in my life SV10>, so I <am glad CO 6>to see there are <survivors C 6,11>. Please, now <get on with your life Q10>.'"
Reliving <trauma BL16,24>
Four months on, Domenach was doing his best to follow the officer's advice. Then, a week ago, as he scanned his Twitter feed before heading to work, word of the attacks in Brussels started filtering through.
"[People were] saying that there was this <explosion B3> in Belgium and instantly I understood what happened, that <it was another attack HL7,8>. I knew right away," he recalls.

Many <people are feared BL4,11 trapped under the concrete BN4,11> and steel bridge, which fell on a busy road. Images show residents using their <bare hands to help TU1,6> the rescue effort.
<Safety C 6,11> issues such as <lack of inspections EM14> and the use of substandard materials have <plagued EL 7,16> construction projects in the country.
The accident took place in an area near Girish Park, one of Kolkata's most densely populated neighbourhoods, with narrow lanes, and shops and houses built close together.
The 2km-long (1.2 mile) flyover has been under construction since 2009 and <missed several deadlines EM14> for completion.
The causes of the <disaster BL 3,16> were not immediately clear but the company in charge of the construction, IVRCL, said it would cooperate with investigators.

1)Life on the frontline in Ukraine a year on from Minsk peace deal
http://www.euronews.com/2016/02/03/ukraine-life-in-the-village-of-zolotoe-3-in-the-luhansk-region/ 

The <scars of conflict EF5> run deep in eastern Ukraine and not just through the <ruined homes F5>. Zolotoe 3 is a village in the Luhansk region just two kilometres from the <front line E5> on the government-controlled side.
It is almost a year since the Minsk agreement to <resolve the crisis CT6> and while the fighting has subsided life remains a <daily struggle E5>.
Svetlana is a single mother and like many of her neighbours <without a job G10>. The factory where she used to work lies on the other side of the front line in the <self proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic E 4,7>.
“<I had to leave my job G10> in the <pro-Russian controlled territory E7> because it’s not accessible at the moment, that’s why we are staying here, and we can’t afford to leave. I hope that when <the war is over CW 11>, things will go back to the way they were. Ukraine will always be Ukraine. I don’t believe in anybody, neither Poroshenko, nor anyone else,” she told euronews.
The local Kindergarten is <deserted and closed F24>, <damaged by shelling JM 7,14>. Only 11 pupils attend the village’s primary school. Many who stayed when <the conflict E5> broke out were simply too old to leave.
“I just want people to come up with a common understanding so that peace can return and our kindergarten can be rebuilt. I still hear the children’s voices…” the director of the kindergarten said, her voice trembling at the memories.
In the <empty streets FV 24> and <ruined buildings FV 24> there is an unnerving silence and little activity.
Many of the villagers who fled at the height of <the conflict> have returned because <they have nowhere else to go FV 24>. However, most of them, who used to work at the local coal-mine, are now unemployed as it has closed down because of <the war>. They rely on assistance from NGOs and the UNHCR.
“There is also a <ceasefire C 6,11> since September which isn’t holding perfectly, but it’s holding enough for some families to perceive that they could come home. And in addition to that, unfortunately, there are many families who told us the main reason they came back is when they displaced to whichever city or town, they weren’t able to find enough assistance to get by,” said Jeff Wilkinson Head of UNHCR in Severdonetsk region.
According to the UNHCR there are now around 800 people living in the village. Before <the conflict E5> there was a population of 1200.
The UN agency provides what is called “winter non-food aid” to those that are in the village. There are blankets, clothes candles and coal as well as building supplies to help <repair the damaged buildings C6> as those that remain try <to rebuild their lives and their homes C 6,11,20>.

44.    Ukraine: four dead as bus trips mine in divided Donetsk

http://www.euronews.com/2016/02/10/ukraine-bus-trips-mine-in-divided-donetsk-four-dead/

At least four people have been <killed FHV 5,10,16> after a bus <drove over a mine H5> in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.
Reports from the locality suggest the driver tried to manoeuvre around a checkpoint and drove into a field <detonating the explosive E5>.
Nineteen others have been <injured 10 EV>.
The <disputed and divided area EV5> controlled by both <pro-Russian separatists E 4,13,14> and the Ukrainian government is littered with checkpoints and <ordnance L1>.
One mother spoke of the daily drudgery:
“It’s scary, because we are <afraid B5> not only to go to the side of the road, but even step out onto the tarmac. <terribleB5>, <it’s unbearable EF5>. Before we could skip the queue with the child, but now we have to wait for kilometres, dozens of kilometres, at a standstill.”
<The battle E 5,24> for control of Donetsk <continues ELV 5,24> with sporadic <clashes E5> between government forces and <pro-Moscow militia>.
<The epicentre of the fighting ELV 5,24> is around the Donetsk airport.
A Ukranian platoon commander described the exchanges:“You hear how quiet it is now when the <shooting E5> stops. Before they were <shooting E5> at us from 300 metres wIth automatic <weapons E5>.”
Since the <conflict E5> broke out in November 214 more than 9,000 people have been <killed  H 5,7,24>.


45.  Normal life in East Ukraine waits on demining efforts

http://www.euronews.com/2016/02/08/normal-life-in-east-ukraine-waits-on-demining-efforts/ 

Wednesday is the first anniversary of the Minsk agreement that was supposed to end the <crisis EL 5,16> between Ukraine and Russia. Mapping and clearing the minefields on the <frontline E5> is part of the deal. In the village of Syze people feel <under siege H24>.
“Mine contamination is another <huge problem E5,16,24> of this area. For instance, this village is completely <surrounded by mines EF 5,10>,” says euronews’ Sergio Cantone.
Mines <stop the farmers from working EN5> their fields, and agriculture is virtually the only work around here, so until <the mines E5> are gone <normal life cannot resume JV 5,24>.
Foreign <NGOs can help CT6>, but only Ukrainian forces are allowed to actually demine. Some of the <minefields E5> are part of their defence system. One Danish NGO says <730 civilians have been killed HJ 10,24> by <mines E5> and <unexploded munitions BE 1,5>. And with the <frontline E5> so close, there is still sporadic <shelling E5> and <sniper fire E5>. The mines were laid in haste with no maps. Fortunately the locals know where they are.
“You can walk only on the paths not to the right, not to the left, not in the forest and not in the fields…We need our money not to go to Kyiv, but to the regions, such as Lviv, Donetsk, Luhansk. It’s not ony about Donetsk and Luhansk it is also about the whole of Ukraine,” says Alexander, a strong supporter of the <federalisation of Ukraine EJM 5,7,21,24>.
The UNHCR is also here distributing aid to the last 13 villagers who have decided to brave out <the crisis EL 5,16> and stay put. They need warm clothes, food, and fuel, and are grateful for the efforts made by the Danes and British, Swiss and French demining charities.
“How much time has passed after WWII and <we still find mines EH 5>. So I don’t think that most of <landmines E5> will be removed in a short period of time. My opinion is that they will keep finding them for quite a long time,” said a Ukrainian military nurse.
Now that <heavy regular fighting E5> has died down serious demining work can begin, but it is a risky business. Some of the <munitions E5> are decades old, some are new and contain no metal so are <hard to find B5,24>. And as the <bombE5> experts say, “it’s the ones you don’t find that you need to find the most”.

46.   Kiev <blames 'Russian aggression A1>' for Ukraine's <skyrocketing inflation GI10>
30 Mar, 2016 15:00
The Ukrainian <inflation rate over the last three years of 80 percent GI10> is “< a result of aggression from Russia GU7 13 >,” according to Ukraine’s Social Policy Minister Pavel Rozenko.
“There was <a high inflation rate E7> of about 80 percent during 2013-2015, <primarily due to the aggression  GU17 > and the <loss of industrial capacity GI0>?,” he said at a government meeting on Wednesday.
At the same time, the minister said Ukraine’s government had managed "to < fulfill only 13 percent of the country's social obligations JS4 >". He, therefore, called for more minimum social standards in the 2017 draft budget <to compensate CQ6> the people for losses from <inflation EL7>.
Russian officials have repeatedly refuted allegations of conducting any <military operations A1> in the Donbass area, calling the allegations < “fake propaganda U18 > 
Russia’s OSCE representative Andrey Kelin said all Kiev’s attempts to call Russia <“the aggressor”A1> has been made <to get Western money and arms EIJ9,19 > 
<Inflation EL7> in Ukraine has been growing since the events of Maidan at the end of 2013, which resulted in the overthrow of Viktor Yanukovich's government.
While <inflation EL7> in 2013 was only 0.5 percent, < it skyrocketed GI10 > to 24.9 percent in 2014 and <more than 50 percent GI10 > in 2015.  
The main reasons for the <slowing economy EG10> and <rising inflation EG10> are the< military conflict EL7,16> in Eastern Ukraine and the <collapse EL7,16 in trade> with Russia. 
Last month, Ukraine Member of Parliament Sergey Sobolev said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had stopped paying the country after the government < failed to implement reforms NU 7> and made scant progress in stamping out <corruption E4>.

In Ukraine, new hryvna banknotes will be <made of flax IKR9>, described by National Bank as a <more durable material already used in dollar notes I23>. It is as of yet unclear if this will make the ailing hryvna sturdier as a currency.  
Ukraine’s National Bank (NBU) said in its press release that new hryvna banknotes will be made of flax fiber. Paper manufacturers, it added, have long been experimenting with other materials, such as cotton, but tapped flax because it was the <cheapest option C6>  
<Other crops like paddy straw or banana fiber were also considered IKR9>, according to NBU’s deputy director Yakov Smoliy. Flax “has long been used to manufacture banknote paper for dollar bills in the US,” he said.
Introducing flax hryvna “<will mark a new stage in the development of our national currency C6>,” Smoliy added. He claimed that the new material would make banknotes <more damage-resistant C6>.
But it will likely take more than that to boost the hryvna’s value and exchange rate. The Ukrainian currency has been <in constant nosedive NS 7,10> over the last two years.
Since the 2014 Euromaidan riots, the NBU changed the hryvna into a floating currency following demands from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Within several months, the hryvna <lost nearly 70 percent of its value E7> against the US dollar, <fueling economic collapse and social instability  GN19>.
To no surprise, the NBU’s statement mentions that the new innovation would “<support domestic agricultural producers С6> and <create more jobs С6>.” 

48. Savchenko case: Will Kremlin <release COQ6,11>  Ukraine pilot?
For two, long days the <chief judge EU4,7,8,14> in this controversial case <mumbled his way through the ruling EJMV4,5,7,8,24>, reading out page after barely audible page.
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35886684
For most people in the small, provincial courtroom the <verdict BGJ7,24> on Tuesday was never in doubt.
But now Nadiya Savchenko has been <declared guilty and sentenced to 22 years behind bars FGHJ3,8,10,17,24>, <international pressure C6> for her <release CO6> is mounting.
"For Nadiya it makes no difference whether she got 10 or 20 years. She is convinced the only way she <will be set free CO 6> is through <political negotiations C11>," one of her lawyers, Nikolai Polozov, told the BBC outside court.
His colleagues say talks are already under way for <her release CO 6>, though they gave no details.
Exchange proposal
She's now been found guilty of <directing artillery fire L7> at the height of the fighting with <Russia-backed rebels ABE 7,16> and <killing two Russian journalists L7> in eastern Ukraine. She continues to deny that.
Nadiya Savchenko also says she was <kidnapped HV1,10> by the <rebels AE 7,16> and <smuggled HV1,10> out of Ukraine after her <capture E7>, and then <arrested HV1,10>.
But the court decreed that her captors suddenly let her go and she headed through <rebel-controlled territory A1> dressed in Ukrainian military fatigues to enter Russia.
"We think that is <a farce AEJ 7,18,24>," insisted Svyatoslav Tsegolko, the press secretary of Ukraine's president who attended the closing sessions of the trial.
"If Russia doesn't want more <sanctions EL 7,14> it <should release C6,11> her and all the Ukrainian <hostages GL10> it has," Mr Tsegolko, listing Oleg Sentsov among others. The film director was found guilty of <planning terrorist acts JM17> in Crimea after its <annexation JM24> by Russia in 2014 - in another case deemed a show trial by the West.
Last week, US President Barack Obama raised the case of Nadiya Savchenko in a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Now the US state department has confirmed that John Kerry will discuss her <"unjust sentence" E7,10> when he meets Russia's president in Moscow on Thursday; a spokesman described the US as "extremely concerned".
The Kremlin has previously batted away criticism, arguing that the trial must run its course. But there has been a slight shift in the language now that justice has been "seen to be done".
Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko has announced that he is prepared to swap two Russians captured in eastern Ukraine for Nadiya Savchenko, and Moscow has not rejected that proposal out of hand.
Ukraine says Yevgeny Yerofeyev and Alexander Alexandrov are elite members of Russian military intelligence but Russia maintains they were not on active duty.
"These questions will be considered in full accordance with Russian law," Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday, before underlining that any such decision would be taken by the president.
The Kremlin's spokesman has used almost identical language.
'Dead or alive'
With calls in Europe for <fresh sanctions CO6,20> in response to this case, the ball seems to be in President Putin's court.
"However you look at it, this doesn't benefit Russia," opposition politician Alexei Navalny argued in his blog.
He described the trial as such an "<obvious stitch-up K18>" <you could "see the threads" K15>, and suggested whoever planned to make an example of Nadiya Savchenko - as a <trophy prisoner JK 8> from the Ukrainian conflict - had <miscalculated K 9,15,18>.
"Most likely, this is <a typical case of idiocy and stubbornness R9,15>," Alexei Navalny <argued A1>, suggesting the Kremlin doesn't want to be seen to give in under pressure.
That could mean Nadiya Savchenko <remains behind bars JV10,24> for a long time.
But she has already set her own ultimatum. Her lawyers say she's vowed to <start another full hunger strike NV5,7,24> in 10 working days - as soon as her verdict comes into effect.
"She doesn't want the Russian authorities to waste time deciding her case," Mr Polozov explained. "She wants <to force them A1> to send her home, <dead or alive BF 1,3>."

49.   Ukraine minister Abromavicius <quits over corruption EJS24>
Ukraine's economy minister Aivarus Abromavicius has resigned in protest at the slow pace of reform in the country.

http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35481699?intlink_from_url=http://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c1400025-cfb7-43cd-8489-91786486f5e3/ukraine-crisis&link_location=live-reporting-story

He said he <did not want to provide "cover" E,F 18,24> for <widespread government corruption EJ 7,28> .
President Petro Poroshenko brought Mr Abromavicius from Lithuania to help spearhead Ukraine's <reform campaign CO 6,20>.
But two years after their pro-Western revolution, many Ukrainians say there has been little change and their country remains <mired in corruption JM7>.
Mr Abromavicius, a 40-year-old ex-banker from Lithuania, was one of several non-Ukrainian experts brought in <to help tackle abuses C6> after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was <toppled C6> in February 2014 and Mr Poroshenko was elected president.
His predecessor as economy minister, Pavlo Sheremeta, <also resigned in frustration EW2 >.

Mr Abromavicius complained that  <officials had actively placed obstacles JMNS 24,28> in his way, even alleging that members of President Poroshenko's administration were blocking him.
He spoke of <systematic and concrete actions aimed at paralysing reforms JMNS 24,28>, "ranging from a <sudden removal of my security detail ELJ 3,7,24> to the pressure <to appoint questionable individuals EJ 5,7> to my team or to key positions in state-owned enterprises".
He even named an MP from the president's party, Igor Kononenko, <accusing him of trying to obstruct EJ 5,7>his team's efforts and of seeking <to influence key appointments EJ 7,28> in state companies.
Mr Kononenko reacted by suggesting that some ministers appeared to be trying to "<switch personal responsibility K18> away from their own guilt and that of their teams, and on to MPs".
Mr Abromavicius's decision is a <stinging condemnation EN 7> of Ukraine's government, says the BBC's David Stern in Kiev. If his resignation is confirmed by parliament, it would be <a heavy blow BE 7,24> to a country still <mired in corruption E 7,16,28>, he adds.
After submitting his resignation, the minister met President Poroshenko who urged him to stay.
"He has now left to deliberate," Mr Poroshenko wrote on Facebook, adding that Ukraine's anti-corruption bureau would <investigate E 16,18> his <complaint E V 7>. Mr Kononenko had also agreed to co-operate, he said.
"The sooner society has answers to the questions, the better," Mr Poroshenko said.
Ten Western ambassadors in Kiev <expressed disappointment S7> at the resignation, in a statement praising the "tough but necessary economic reforms" implemented by his team in the past year.
They called on Ukraine's leaders to "set aside their <parochial differences E7>" and press ahead with further changes.
Among the foreign officials brought in to <tackle corruption COT6,11> in Ukraine was Georgian ex-President Mikheil Saakashvili, who was given the job of governor of the southern region of Odessa.
At the end of last year, President Poroshenko could only look on as a meeting of the National Council for Reforms turned into a <slanging match EJNS5,8,24> between Mr Saakashvili and Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, as they <traded accusations of <corruption E 7,24,28> and <populism E 7,21>EK 7,22>.

<Activists K9> of energy <blockade of Crimea J5> <split C6>

 December 08, 2015, 14:49 UTC+3 
Right Sector <radicals E25> say they will withdraw their blockade <activists K9?> to send them to the Crimea’s border
KIEV, December 8. /TASS/. Following a split among activists of the <so-called K9> energy <blockade of Crimea J5>, Right Sector <radicals E25> said they will withdraw their blockade activists <to send them to the Crimea’s border L5>, the 112 Ukraina television channels said on Tuesday, citing the Right Sector website.

According to 112 Ukraina, the <split C6?> was triggered by the blockade organizers’ decision <to let repair teams finally reach the damaged Kakhovka-Titan electricity transmission line C6> the feeds Crimea with electricity from Ukraine. Right Sector said this decision had not been agreed with it "and other public organizations, <volunteer battalions I25> and <patriotic movements I23>which are members of the headquarters of the <‘Crimean maidan’ W25>[the word ‘maidan,’ or the name of Kiev’s central Independence Square, a venue of grass-roots protests, is used to refer to protest movements of all types — TASS] led by Lenur Islyamov [a member of Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada, or parliament, who claims to be the coordinator of Crimea’s blockade — TASS]."
"We consider <resumption of electricity C6> supplies via one of the electricity transmission lines as another <anti-Ukrainian step E7> made by the current regime and as flirting with our enemies by some of our partners and allies," Right Sector said. "This step is a <concession S10> to our external and domestic enemies."
Electricity supplies via the Kakhovka-Titan transmission line which feeds two districts in Ukraine’s Kherson region and some of Crimean localities <were resumed C6> overnight to Tuesday, after 16 days of energy <blockade of Crimea J5>. According to Russia’s energy ministry, Ukrenergo’s electricity supplies to Crimea on December 8 stood at 104 megawatt (out of 769 megawatt of Crime’s overall generation).
Electricity supplies to Crimea from Ukraine’s Kherson region <were interrupted M7> on November 22 when Ukrainian radicals <blew up A14> transmission pylons at all the four electricity transmission lines. Ever since <one of the <damaged L24> lines — Kakhovka-Titan — <was restored Q6>CQ6>, <energy blockade E7> <activists K9> <have been blocking its use E7>. Russia’s Federal Security Service <initiated a<criminal case L>P14> on charges of <subversive activities AJ 13,14>.
The first electricity transmission line with a capacity of more than 200 megawatt of the <so-called K9> energy bridge linking Crimea and mainland Russia was commissioned in the evening on December 2 in the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Another line with a capacity of 250 megawatt is expected to be commissioned on December 15. The energy bridge is geared <to make Crimea independent S8> from electricity supplies from Ukraine.

Kremlin warns Ukraine will <default L24> unless Kiev repays <debt to Russia MV8> 
 December 08, 2015, 12:50 UTC+3 
Vladimir Putin's press secretary said <Kiev didn't accept Russia's restructuring option E7/J7/8>
http://tass.ru/en/economy/842249

MOSCOW, December 8. /TASS/. The Kremlin has warned that Ukraine will <default L24> unless it repays its debt to Russia.
"A <default L24> situation lies ahead (for Ukraine), just what we were speaking about," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday.
"Russia offered a [debt] restructuring option as [Russian President Vladimir] Putin put forward the initiative in Antalya [at G20 summit]," Peskov said, adding that <"unfortunately, our counterparts did not accept the initiative" S11>.
"The Russian Federation <has no other proposals thus U24/L24/11>, under all norms of financial international relations, (Ukraine) nears <default L24> as this is a sovereign debt," spokesman said.

In mid-November President Putin said that Russia had offered Ukraine to repay its $3 bln debt by $1 bln annual installments in 2016-2018. Putin stressed that Russia offered not only a restructuring but also better terms compared with those asked by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Russia had asked for guarantees on Ukraine’s debt from either the government of the United States or from the European Union, or from one of international financial institutions.
Later Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Storchak said Russia expected the IMF and Ukraine’s creditors to respond before December 8, 2015.
Last week Russia’s Finance Ministry <received an official refusal ES 7> from the US government to provide guarantees on Ukraine’s debt. The Ministry also said Moscow will bring <legal proceedings against Ukraine V24, F24> in case Kiev <fails to repay EJ 7> $3 bln by December 20 this year, which will mean the country’s <sovereign default EN`16,24>.
In December 2013, the presidents of Russia and Ukraine, Vladimir Putin and Viktor Yanukovych, agreed that Moscow would grant Kiev a credit worth $15 bln through the placement of Ukrainian securities. Under the program bonds for 3 bln dollars were placed on the Irish Stock Exchange on December 20, 2013. Russia purchased the bonds using the funds from its National Welfare Fund.

52.  Assad says Erdogan's army fighting in Syria

https://www.rt.com/news/337877-assad-turkish-troops-syria/
Published time: 31 Mar, 2016 12:47
The army of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is currently fighting in Syria, but the country is ready <to respond to the aggression B16>, Syrian President Bashar Assad said in an exclusive interview with Sputnik.
Turkey, as well as Saudi Arabia, <have "crossed all possible red lines U14>, possibly from the first weeks of the Syrian <war ABE 1,5,16>," Assad said. 
"Today, the <war ABE 1,5,16> against Erdogan and against Saudi Arabia is <<a war ABE 1,5,16> against terrorists A16>. The Turkish army, which is not even Turkish, is Erdogan's army that is <fighting A1> today in Syria," he added.
Everything that Ankara and Riyadh “have done from the very beginning can be considered <aggression AB 1>. <Aggression АB 1> in a political sense or in a military sense – <providing terrorists with arms AE 7> – or <direct aggression АB1> with the <use of artillery B7>, and other <military violations B7>," he stressed. 
Erdogan is directly <supporting the terrorists E21 14,18,19> as “he <allows them to move into Turkish territory J 14,18,19>, <to carry out maneuvers with tanks BJ 1621>?,” the Syrian president said. 
“This concerns not only individuals, he <finances them [terrorists] J7> through Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and through Turkey itself, of course,” he said. 
According to Assad, his Turkish counterpart “trades oil that has been stolen by IS (Islamic State, Daesh), at the same time <carrying out artillery attacks B16> against the Syrian army - when it moves close - in order <to help the terrorists E J7>.”
According to the President, countermeasures to Turkey's <aggressive actions A 1,13,16> must first of all take place within Syrian territory.
<Successful strikes against terrorist AC 6 > in the country will lead to the <failure of policies pursued by Turkey’s president Q11>, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he added.
"They are <terrorists AB 1,16> and when we attack these <terrorists in Syria AB 1,16>, this leads to Erdogan's <direct defeat U11>," Assad said. 
However, Assad stressed that <there was no dispute Q20> between the peoples of Syria and Turkey.
<The relations between the two countries will be “good” Q11> if Erdogan stops interfering in Syrian affairs, he explained.

53.    Smugglers offer Turkey to Italy boat crossings.
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/31/smugglers-offer-turkey-to-italy-boat-crossings-facebook-ad-eu-greece.
March 30, 2016.

<Turkey-based smugglers E 21,7,14> have begun to re-advertise trips between Turkey and Italy, in the first hint of a shift in migration patterns since the EU agreed a deal to <deport any refugees L10,С6> landing in Greece.
In an advert on Facebook <smugglers E7,21,14> claimed that the first boat to Italy would leave this weekend from the port of Mersin. They offered places for <$4,000 (£2,780) per person I23>, a journey that would be about <four times more expensive I18> than transport from Turkey to Greece.
“The trip is on Saturday, from Mersin to Italy, on a merchant ship 110 metres long, <equipped with food, water, life jackets and medicine C17>,” the post read, accompanied by photographs of a cargo ship.
Reacting to the advert some refugees raised the possibility of the scheme <being a scam E7>, since scores of would-be migrants were tricked in 2014 and 2015 by people posing as organisers of similar trips.
In response, the advert’s author claimed that passengers’ money would be held by a third-party trusted by both the smugglers and passengers, meaning that <the former stood to gain little I21> if their clients <failed to arrive in Italy J24>.
Whatever the truth, the development nevertheless indicates increased demand for alternative routes to Europe now that <it has become harder to leave Turkey for Greece L24>.
Over the past year more than one million refugees have reached the EU by crossing the sea between the Greek and Turkish coasts. But this tactic all but ended in the past fortnight after <the EU agreed a deal Q11> that in theory could mean almost all arrivals to the Greek islands eventually <being deported back to Turkey Q6>.
Contacted by the Guardian, the <smuggler Е 7,14,21> who posted the advert claimed it was the first time he had organised a journey to Italy in months. He refused to confirm where in Italy the boat would land. 

54.      Savchenko case: Will Kremlin release Ukraine pilot?

For two, long days the chief judge in this <controversial case E 24>  mumbled his way through the ruling, reading out page after barely audible page.
